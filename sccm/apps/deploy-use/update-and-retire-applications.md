# Update and retire applications with System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


It's likely that eventually you'll want to make changes to an application, uninstall an application, or replace an already deployed application with a new application. System Center Configuration Manager gives you these capabilities, to help you update and retire applications:  

-   **Revise applications**. When you make changes to an application or deployment type, Configuration Manager maintains a history of the changes. You can revert the application to a previous revision at any time. You also can view its properties, restore a previous revision of an application, or delete an old revision.  

  For more information, see [Application revisions](revise-and-supersede-applications.md#application-revisions).  

-   **Supersede applications**. You can upgrade or replace existing applications by using a supersedence relationship. When you supersede an application, you can specify a new deployment type to replace the deployment type of the superseded application. Also, you can set whether to upgrade or uninstall the superseded application before the superseding application is installed.  

  For more information, see [Application supersedence](revise-and-supersede-applications.md#application-supersedence).  

-   **Uninstall applications**. Configuration Manager makes uninstalling an application easy. This can be accomplished silently, without any intervention from the application or device user.  

  For more information, see [Uninstall applications](uninstall-applications.md).
