# Uninstall applications with System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


Take the following actions to uninstall an application you previously deployed.

-   Specify the command line to uninstall the deployment type content on the **Content** page of the Create Deployment Type Wizard.  

-   Deploy the application by using a deployment action of **Uninstall**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Some application types do not support uninstallation.  

 This list gives you more information about how application uninstall works:  

-   When you uninstall a System Center Configuration Manager (Configuration Manager) application, any dependent applications are not automatically uninstalled.  

-   If you deploy an application that uses an action of **Uninstall** to a user, and the application was installed for all users of the computer, the uninstall might fail if the userâ€™s account does not have permissions to uninstall the application.  

-   If you remove a user or a device from a collection that has an application deployed to it, the application is not automatically removed from the device.  

-   A deployment with the deployment purpose of **Uninstall** does not check requirement rules. If the application is installed on the computer on which the deployment runs, it will be uninstalled.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must delete any existing deployments or simulated deployments of an application to a collection before you can deploy the application with a deployment action of **Uninstall**.  

 For more information about how to create a deployment type, see [Create applications](../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md).  

 For more information about how to deploy an application, see [Deploy applications](../../apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications.md).  

## Uninstall an application  

1.  Configure the application deployment type with the uninstall command line by using one of the following methods:  

    -   On the **General** page of the Create Deployment Wizard, select the option **Automatically identify information about this deployment type from installation files**. If the information is available in the installation files, the uninstall command line is automatically added to the deployment type properties.  

    -   On the **Content** page of the Create Deployment Type Wizard, in the **Uninstall program** field, specify the command line to uninstall the application.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  The **Content** page is displayed only if you select the option **Manually specify the deployment type information** on the **General** page of the Create Deployment Type Wizard.  

    -   On the **Programs** tab of the **<*deployment type name*> Properties** dialog box, specify the command line to uninstall the application in the **Uninstall program** field.  

2.  Deploy the application, and then select the deployment action **Uninstall** on the **Deployment Settings** page of the Deploy Software Wizard.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select a deployment action of **Uninstall**, the deployment purpose is automatically configured as **Required**.
