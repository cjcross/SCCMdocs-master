# Proxy server support in System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Both System Center Configuration Manager site system servers and clients can use a proxy server.  

## Site system servers  
When site system roles need to connect to the Internet, you can configure them to use a proxy server.  

-   A computer that hosts a site system server supports a single proxy server configuration that is shared by all site system roles on that same computer. If you need separate proxy servers for different roles or instances of a role, you must place those roles on separate site system servers.  

-   When you configure new proxy server settings for a site system server that already has a proxy server configuration, the original configuration is overwritten.  

-   Connections to the proxy use the **System** account of the computer that hosts the site system role.  

The following site system roles connect to the Internet and might require a proxy server.  With one exception, site system roles that can use a proxy do so with no additional configuration. The exception is the software update point. The following list has information about the additional configurations that a software update point requires:  

**Asset Intelligence synchronization point** - This site system role connects to Microsoft and uses a proxy server configuration on the computer that hosts the Asset Intelligence synchronization point.  

**Cloud-based distribution point** - To set up a proxy server for a cloud-based distribution point, you set up the proxy on the primary site that manages the cloud-based distribution point.  

For this configuration, the primary site server:  

-   Must be able to connect to Microsoft Azure to set up, monitor, and distribute content to the distribution point.  

-   Uses that computer's System account to make the connection.  

-   Uses that computer's default web browser.  

You cannot set up a proxy server on the cloud-based-distribution point in Microsoft Azure.  

**Cloud connection point** - This site system role connects to the Configuration Manager cloud service to download version updates for Configuration Manager and uses a proxy server that's configured on the computer that hosts the service connection point.  

**Exchange Server connector** - This site system role connects to an Exchange Server and uses a proxy server configuration on the computer that hosts the Exchange Server connector.  

**Service connection point** - This site system role connects to Microsoft Intune and uses a proxy server configuration on the computer that hosts the service connection point.  

**Software updates point** - This site system role can use the proxy when it connects to Microsoft Update to download patches and synchronize information about updates. Software update points use a proxy only for the following options when you enable that option as you set up the software update point:  

-   **Use a proxy server when synchronizing software updates**  

-   **Use a proxy server when downloading content by using automatic deployment rules** (While available for use, this setting is not used by software update points at secondary sites.)  

Configure the proxy server settings on the Active Software Update Point page of the Add Site System Roles wizard or on the **General** tab in **Software Update Point Component Properties**.  

-   The proxy server settings are associated only with the software update point at the site.  

-   Proxy server options are only available when a proxy server is already set up for the site system server that hosts the software update point.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  By default, the **System** account for the server on which an automatic deployment rule was created is used to connect to the Internet and download software updates when the automatic deployment rules run.  
>   
>  When this account cannot access the Internet, software updates fail to download and the following entry is logged to ruleengine.log: **Failed to download the update from internet. Error = 12007.**  

#### To set up the proxy server for a site system server  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, choose **Administration**, expand **Site Configuration**, and then choose **Servers and Site System Roles**.  

2.  Choose the site system server that you want to edit, in the details pane right-click **Site system**, and then choose **Properties**.  

3.  In Site system Properties, select the **Proxy** tab, and then set up the proxy settings for this primary site server.  

4.  Choose **OK** to save the new proxy server configuration.
