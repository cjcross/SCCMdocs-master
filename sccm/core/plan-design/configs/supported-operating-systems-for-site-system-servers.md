# Supported operating systems for System Center Configuration Manager site system servers

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


This article details the Windows versions that you can use to host a System Center Configuration Manager site or site system role.


Use the information in this topic with the information in the following articles:
-   [Recommended hardware for Configuration Manager](../../../core/plan-design/configs/recommended-hardware.md)
-   [Site and site system prerequisites for Configuration Manager](../../../core/plan-design/configs/site-and-site-system-prerequisites.md)
