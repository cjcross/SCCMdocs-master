# Site and site system prerequisites for System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


 Windows-based computers require specific configurations to support their use as System Center Configuration Manager site system servers.  

 
 For some products, like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for the software update point, you need to refer to the product documentation to identify additional prerequisites and limitations for use of that product. Only configurations that directly apply for use with Configuration Manager are included here.   

> [!NOTE]  
>  In January 2016, support expired for the .NET Framework 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5.1. For more information, see [Microsoft .NET Framework Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/framework_faq?WT.mc_id=azurebg_email_Trans_943_NET452_Update) at support.microsoft.com.  

## <a name="bkmk_generalprerewq"></a> General site server requirements and limitations
**The following apply to all site system servers:**

-   Each site system server must use a 64-bit operating system. The only exception to this is the distribution point site system role, which you can install on some 32-bit operating systems.  

-   Site systems are not supported on Server Core installations of any operating system. An exception to this is that Server Core installations are supported for the distribution point site system role, without PXE or multicast support.  

-   After a site system server is installed, it's not supported to change:  

    -   The domain name of the domain where the site system computer is located (also called a **domain rename**).  

    -   The domain membership of the computer.  

    -   The name of the computer.  

  If you must change any of these, you must first remove the site system role from the computer and then reinstall the role after the change is complete. If this affects the site server computer, you must uninstall the site and then reinstall the site after the change is complete.  

-   Site system roles are not supported on an instance of a Windows Server cluster. The only exception to this is the site database server.  

-   It's not supported to change the startup type or "Log on as" settings for any Configuration Manager service. If you do this, you might prevent key services from running correctly.

**Computer memory:**  

-   The computer that hosts this site system role must have a minimum of 5% of the computer's available memory free to enable the site system role to process requests.  

-   When this site system role is co-located with another site system role that has this same requirement, this memory requirement for the computer doesn't increase, but remains at a minimum of 5%.

**IIS configuration:**

The default IIS configuration is required with the following additions:  

-   IIS 6 Management Compatibility:  

    -   IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility  

###  <a name="bkmk_2008MPpreq"></a> Management point  
**.NET Framework:**  

-   .NET Framework 4.5.2  

**IIS configuration:**

You can use the default IIS configuration or a custom configuration. Each management point that you enable to support mobile devices requires the additional IIS configuration for ASP.NET (and its automatically selected options).

In some scenarios, such as when IIS is installed or reconfigured after the .NET Framework version 4.5.2 is installed, you must explicitly enable ASP.NET version 4.5. For example, on a 64-bit computer that runs the .NET Framework version 4.0.30319, run the following command: **%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\aspnet_regiis.exe -i -enable**  


To use a custom IIS configuration, you must enable the following options for IIS:  

-   Application Development:  

    -   ISAPI Extensions  

-   Security:  

    -   Windows Authentication  

-   IIS 6 Management Compatibility:  

    -   IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility  

    -   IIS 6 WMI Compatibility  


When you use a custom IIS configuration, you can remove options that aren't required, such as the following:  

-   Common HTTP Features:  

    -   HTTP Redirection  

-   IIS Management Scripts and Tools  

**Windows feature:**  

-   BITS Server Extensions (and automatically selected options), or Background Intelligent Transfer Services (BITS) (and automatically selected options)  

###  <a name="bkmk_2008RSpoint"></a> Reporting services point  
**.NET Framework:**  

-   .NET Framework 4.5.2  

**SQL Server Reporting Services:**  

-   You must install and configure at least one instance of SQL Server to support SQL Server Reporting Services before installing the reporting services point.  

-   The instance that you use for SQL Server Reporting Services can be the same instance you use for the site database.  

-   Additionally, the instance that you use can be shared with other System Center products as long as the other System Center products don't have restrictions for sharing the instance of SQL Server.  

###  <a name="bkmk_2008SCPpreq"></a> Service connection point  
**.NET Framework:**  

-   .NET Framework 4.5.2  

     When this site system role installs, if the server doesn't already have a supported version of the .NET Framework installed, Configuration Manager automatically installs the .NET Framework 4.5.2. This installation can place the server into a reboot pending state. When a reboot is pending for the .NET Framework, .NET applications might fail until after the server reboots and the installation finishes.  

**Visual C++ Redistributable:**  

-   Configuration Manager installs the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package on each computer that hosts a distribution point.  

-   The site system role requires the x64 version.  

###  <a name="bkmk_2008SUPpreq"></a> Software update point  
**.NET Framework:**  

-   .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 (or later)  

-   .NET Framework 4.5.2  

**IIS configuration:**

The default IIS configuration is required.  

**Windows Server Update Services:**  

-   You must install the Windows Server role Windows Server Update Services on a computer before installing a software update point.  

-   For more information, see [Plan for software updates in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../sum/plan-design/plan-for-software-updates.md).
