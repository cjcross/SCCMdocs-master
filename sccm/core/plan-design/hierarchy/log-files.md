# Log files in System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

In System Center Configuration Manager, client and site server components record process information in individual log files. You can use the information in the log files to help you troubleshoot issues that might occur in your Configuration Manager hierarchy. By default, client and server component logging is enabled in Configuration Manager.   

 The following sections provide details about the different log files available to you. You can use this information to view and monitor Configuration Manager client and server logs for operation details, and to identify error information that might help you troubleshoot any problems.

##  <a name="BKMK_AboutLogs"></a> About Configuration Manager log files  
 Most processes in Configuration Manager write operational information to a log file that is dedicated to that process. The log files are identified by **.log** or **.lo_** file extensions. Configuration Manager writes to a .log file until that log reaches its maximum size. When the log is full, the .log file is copied to a file of the same name but with the .lo_ extension, and the process or component continues to write to the .log file. When the .log file again reaches its maximum size, the .lo_ file is overwritten and the process repeats. Some components establish a log file history by appending a date and time stamp to the log file name and by retaining the .log extension. An exception to the maximum size and use of the .lo_ file is the client for Linux and UNIX. For information about how the client for Linux and UNIX uses log files, see [Manage log files in the client for Linux and UNIX](#BKMK_ManageLinuxLogs) in this topic.  

 To view the logs, use the Configuration Manager log viewer tool CMTrace, located in the \\SMSSetup\\Tools folder of the Configuration Manager source media. The CMTrace tool is added to all boot images that are added to the Software Library.  

###  <a name="BKMK_LogOptions"></a> Configure logging options by using Configuration Manager Service Manager  
 In Configuration Manager, you can change where log files are stored, and you can change the log file size.  

 To modify the size of log files, change the name and location of the log file, or to force multiple components to write to a single log file, do the following steps.  

#### To modify logging for a component  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, select **Monitoring**, select **System Status**, and then select either **Site Status** or **Component Status**.  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Component** group, select **Start**, and then select **Configuration Manager Service Manager**.  
3.  When Configuration Manager Service Manager opens, connect to the site that you want to manage. If the site that you want to manage isn't shown, select **Site**, select **Connect**, and then enter the name of the site server for the correct site.  
4.  Expand the site and go to **Components** or **Servers**, depending on where the components that you want to manage are located.  
5.  In the right pane, select one or more components.  
6.  On the **Component** menu, select **Logging**.  
7.  In the **Configuration Manager Component Logging** dialog box, complete the available configuration options for your selection.  
8.  Select **OK** to save the configuration.  

###  <a name="BKMK_LogLocation"></a> Find Configuration Manager logs  
Configuration Manager log files are stored in various locations that depend on the process that creates the log file and on the configuration of your site systems. Because the location of the log on a computer can vary, use the search function to find the relevant log files on your Configuration Manager computers if you need to troubleshoot a specific scenario.

###  <a name="BKMK_LogFilesforLnU"></a> Client for Linux and UNIX  
 The Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX records information in the following log files.  

> [!TIP]  
>  Beginning with clients for Linux and UNIX from Cumulative Update 1, you can use CMTrace to view the log files for the client for Linux and UNIX.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you use the initial release of the client for Linux and UNIX and reference the documentation in this section, replace the following references for each file or process:  
>   
>  -   Replace **omiserver.bin** with **nwserver.bin**  
> -   Replace **omi** with **nanowbem**  

|Log name|Details|  
|--------------|-------------|  
|Scxcm.log|The log file for the core service of the Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX (ccmexec.bin). This log file contains information about the installation and ongoing operations of ccmexec.bin.<br /><br /> By default, this log file is located at **/var/opt/microsoft/scxcm.log**<br /><br /> To change the location of the log file, edit **/opt/microsoft/configmgr/etc/scxcm.conf** and change the **PATH** field. You do not need to restart the client computer or service for the change to take effect.<br /><br /> You can set the log level to one of four different settings.|  
|Scxcmprovider.log|The log file for the CIM service of the Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX (omiserver.bin). This log file contains information about the ongoing operations of nwserver.bin.<br /><br /> This log is located at**/var/opt/microsoft/configmgr/scxcmprovider.log**<br /><br /> To change the location of the log file, edit **/opt/microsoft/omi/etc/scxcmprovider.conf** and change the **PATH** field. You do not need to restart the client computer or service for the change to take effect.<br /><br /> You can set the log level to one of three settings.|  

 Both log files support several levels of logging:  

-   **scxcm.log**. To change the log level, edit **/opt/microsoft/configmgr/etc/scxcm.conf** and change each instance of the  **MODULE** tag to the log level you want:  

    -   ERROR: Indicates problems that require attention  

    -   WARNING: Indicates possible problems for client operations  

    -   INFO: More detailed logging that indicates the status of various events on the client  

    -   TRACE: Verbose logging that typically is used to diagnose problems  

-   **scxcmprovider.log**. To change the log level, edit **/opt/microsoft/omi/etc/scxcmprovider.conf** and change each instance of the **MODULE** tag to the log level you want:  

    -   ERROR: Indicates problems that require attention  

    -   WARNING: Indicates possible problems for client operations

    -   INFO: More detailed logging that indicates the status of various events on the client  

Under normal operating conditions, use the ERROR log level. This log level creates the smallest log file. As the log level is increased from ERROR to WARNING, to INFO, and then to TRACE, a larger log file is created as more data is written to the file.  

####  <a name="BKMK_ManageLinuxLogs"></a> Manage log files for the Linux and UNIX client  
The client for Linux and UNIX does not limit the maximum size of the client log files, nor does the client automatically copy the contents of its .log files to another file, such as to a .lo_ file. If you want to control the maximum size of log files, implement a process to manage the log files independent from the Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX.  

For example, you can use the standard Linux and UNIX command **logrotate** to manage the size and rotation of the client log files. The Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX has an interface that enables **logrotate** to signal the client when the log rotation completes, so the client can resume logging to the log file.  

For information about **logrotate**, see the documentation for the Linux and UNIX distributions that you use.  

###  <a name="BKMK_LogfilesforMac"></a> Client for Mac computers  
The Configuration Manager client for Mac computers records information in the following log files.  

|Log name|Details|  
|--------------|-------------|  
|CCMClient-&lt;*date_time*>.log|Records activities that are related to the Mac client operations, including application management, inventory, and error logging.<br /><br /> This log file is located in the /Library/Application Support/Microsoft/CCM/Logs folder on the Mac computer.|  
|CCMAgent-&lt;*date_time*>.log|Records information that is related to client operations, including user logon and logoff operations, and Mac computer activity.<br /><br /> This log file is in the ~/Library/Logs folder on the Mac computer.|  
|CCMNotifications-&lt;*date_time*>.log|Records activities that are related to Configuration Manager notifications displayed on the Mac computer.<br /><br /> This log file is located in the ~/Library/Logs folder on the Mac computer.|  
|CCMPrefPane-&lt;*date_time*>.log|Records activities related to the Configuration Manager preferences dialog box on the Mac computer, which includes general status and error logging.<br /><br /> This log file is located in the ~/Library/Logs folder on the Mac computer.|  

The log file SMS_DM.log on the site system server also records communication between Mac computers and the management point that is set up for mobile devices and Mac computers.
