# Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) for System Center Configuration Manager*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*
During installation of the System Center Configuration Manager console, you can choose to participate in the **Customer Experience Improvement Program** (CEIP). Although CEIP is turned off by default, if it was previously enabled, it will remain enabled.  

-   CEIP is separate from [Diagnostics and usage data for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/plan-design/diagnostics/diagnostics-and-usage-data.md).  

-   CEIP is per console and collects data such as the number of times that each element is selected in the user interface.  

-   Read the [CEIP privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/products/ceip/en-us/privacypolicy.mspx) online.  

You can change the CEIP settings per console installation. In the console, go to the console's backstage tab (the upper left tab with the dropdown arrow), and select **Customer Experience Improvement Program** to change the settings.
