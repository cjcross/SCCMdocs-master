# How to monitor clients in System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


 Once the System Center Configuration Manager client application has been installed on the Windows computers and devices in your site, you can monitor their health and activity in the Configuration Manager console.  

##  <a name="bkmk_about"></a> About client status  
 Configuration Manager provides the following types of information as client status:  

-   **Client online status** - Beginning in version 1602 of Configuration Manager, this status indicates if the computer is online or not. A computer is considered online if it is connected to it's assigned management point.  To indicate that the client is online, it sends ping-like messages to the management point. If the management point doesn't receive a message in 5 minutes or so, the client is considered offline.  

-   **Client activity** - This status indicates if the client has been actively engaging with Configuration Manager over the last 7 days. If the client hasn't requested a policy update, sent a heartbeat message, or sent hardware inventory in 7 days, the client is considered inactive.  

-   **Client check** - This status indicates the success of the periodic evaluation that the Configuration Manager client runs on the computer.  The evaluation checks the computer and can remediate some of the problems it finds. For more information, see [Checks and remediations made by client check](#BKMK_ClientHealth).  

     On computers that run Windows 7, client check runs as a scheduled task. On later operating systems, client check runs automatically during the Windows maintenance window.  

     You can configure remediation not to run on specific computers, for example, a business-critical server. In addition, if there are additional items that you want to evaluate, you can use Configuration Manager compliance settings to provide a comprehensive solution to monitor the overall health, activity, and compliance of computers in your organization. For more information about compliance settings, see [Plan for and configure compliance settings in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../compliance/plan-design/plan-for-and-configure-compliance-settings.md).  

##  <a name="bkmk_indStatus"></a> Monitor the status of individual clients  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Assets and Compliance** > **Devices** or choose a collection under **Device Collections**.  

     Beginning in version 1602 of Configuration Manager,  the icons at the beginning of each row indicate the online status of the device:  

    |||  
    |-|-|  
    |![online status icon for clients](../../../core/clients/manage/media/online-status-icon.png)|Device is online.|  
    |![offline status icon for clients](../../../core/clients/manage/media/offline-status-icon.png)|Device is offline.|  
    |![unknown status icon for clients](../../../core/clients/manage/media/unknown-status-icon.png)|Online status is unknown.|  
    |![client not installed](../../../core/clients/manage/media/client-not-installed.png)|Client is not installed on device.|  

2.  For more detailed online status, add the client online status information to the device view by right-clicking the column header and clicking the online status fields you want to add. The columns you can add are  

    -   **Device Online Status** indicates whether the client is currently online or offline. (This is the same information given by the icons).  

    -   **Last Online Time** indicates when the client online status changed to online.  

    -   **Last Offline Time** indicates when the status changed to offline.  

3.  Click an individual client in the list pane to see more status in the detail pane including information about client activity and client checks.  

##  <a name="bkmk_allStatus"></a> Monitor the status of all clients  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Monitoring** > **Client Status**. On this page of the console, you can review the overall statistics for client activity and client checks across the site.  You can also change the scope of the information by choosing a different collection.  

2.  To drill down into detail about the reported statistics, click the name of the reported information (such as **Active clients that have passed client check or no results**) and review the information about the individual clients.  

3.  Click **Client Activity** to see charts depicting the client activity in your Configuration Manager site.  

4.  Click **Client Check** to see charts depicting the status of client checks in your Configuration Manager site.  

 You can configure alerts to notify you when clients check results or client activity drops below a specified percentage of clients in a collection or when remediation fails on a specified percentage of clients. For information about how to configure client status, see [How to configure client status in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/clients/deploy/configure-client-status.md).  

##  <a name="BKMK_ClientHealth"></a> Checks and remediations made by client check
