# How to manage collections in System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Use the overview information in this topic to help you perform management tasks for collections in System Center Configuration Manager.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about how to create Configuration Manager collections, see [How to create collections in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections.md).  

## How to manage device collections  
 In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Device Collections**, select the collection to manage, and then select a management task.  

 Use the following table for more information about the management tasks that might require some information before you select them.  

|Management task|Details|More information|  
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|  
|**Show Members**|Displays all of the resources that are members of the selected collection in a temporary node under the **Devices** node.|No additional information.|  
|**Add Selected Items**|Provides the following options to perform one of the following actions:<br /><br /> - <br />                    **Add Selected Items to Existing Device Collection** - Opens the **Select Collection** dialog box where you can select the collection to which you want to add the members of the selected collection. The selected collection is included in this collection by using an **Include Collections** membership rule.<br /><br /> - **Add Selected Items to New Device Collection** - Opens the **Create Device Collection Wizard** where you can create a new collection. The selected collection is included in this collection by using an **Include Collections** membership rule.|[How to create collections in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections.md)|  
|**Install Client**|Opens the **Install Client Wizard** which uses client push installation to install a Configuration Manager client on all computers in the selected collection.|[How to deploy clients to Windows computers](../../../../core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers.md)|

|**Export**|Opens the **Export Collection Wizard** that helps you export this collection to a Managed Object Format (MOF) file that can then be archived or used at another Configuration Manager site.<br /><br /> When you export a collection, collections that are referenced by the selected collection through the use of an **Include** or **Exclude** rule are not exported.|No additional information.|  
|**Copy**|Creates a copy of the selected collection. The new collection uses the selected collection as a limiting collection.|No additional information.|
