# Monitor cloud management gateway in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Beginning in version 1610, after the cloud management gateway service is running and clients are connecting through it, you can monitor clients and network traffic to make sure you know how the service is performing.

## Monitor clients

Clients connected through the cloud management gateway service appear in the Configuration Manager console the same way on-premises clients do. For more information, see [how to monitor clients](monitor-clients.md).

## Monitor traffic in the console

You can monitor traffic on cloud management gateway using the Configuration Manager console:

1. Go to **Administration > Cloud Services > Cloud Management Gateway**.

2. Select the cloud management gateway service in the list pane.

3. View the traffic information in the details pane for the cloud management gateway connection role and the site system roles it connects to.

## Set up outbound traffic alerts

Outbound traffic alerts will help you know when traffic approaches a 14-day (2 week) threshold level. You are given the option of setting up traffic alerts when you create the cloud management gateway service. If you skipped that part, you can still set up the alerts after the service is running. And you can also adjust the alert settings at any time.

1. Go to **Administration > Cloud Services > Cloud Management Gateway**.

2. Right-click the cloud management gateway service in the list pane, and choose **Properties**.

3. Click the Alerts tab, and choose to turn on (or off) the threshold and alerts. Then specify the 14-day threshold (in GB) and percentages of the threshold for raising the different alert levels.

4. Click **OK** when you're done.

## Monitor logs

The cloud management gateway service generates entries in a number of log files. For more information, see [Configuration Manager logs](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/log-files).
