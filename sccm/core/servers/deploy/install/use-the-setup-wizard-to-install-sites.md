# Use the Setup Wizard to install System Center Configuration Manager sites

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


To install a new System Center Configuration Manager site by using a guided user interface, you use the Configuration Manager Setup Wizard (setup.exe). The wizard supports installing a primary site or central administration site. You also use the wizard to [upgrade an Evaluation installation](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/upgrade-an-evaluation-install-to-a-full-install.md) of Configuration Manager to a fully licensed installation. When you don't want to use the wizard, you can instead use an [installation script](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/use-a-command-line-to-install-sites.md) and run an unattended command-line installation.

To install a secondary site, you must install the site from within the Configuration Manager console. Secondary sites don't support a scripted command-line installation.

## <a name="bkmk_primary"></a> Install a central administration site or primary site
Use the following procedure to install a central administration site or a primary site, or to upgrade an evaluation site to a fully licensed Configuration Manager site.   

Before starting the site installation, be familiar with the details in the following articles:
 -  [Prepare to install sites](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/prepare-to-install-sites.md)
 -  [Prerequisites for installing sites](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/prerequisites-for-installing-sites.md)

If you're installing a central administration site as part of a site expansion scenario, review the [Expanding a stand-alone primary site](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/use-the-setup-wizard-to-install-sites.md#bkmk_expand) section of this topic before using the following procedure.

### <a name="bkmk_installpri"></a> To install a primary or central administration site

1.  On the computer where you want to install the site, run **&lt;InstallationMedia\>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64\Setup.exe** to start the **System Center Configuration Manager Setup Wizard**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you install a central administration site to expand on a stand-alone primary site, or install a new child primary site in an existing hierarchy, you must use installation media (source files) that matches the version of the existing site or sites. If you've installed in-console updates that have changed the version of the previously installed sites, don't use the original installation media. Instead, use source files from the [CD.Latest folder](../../../../core/servers/manage/the-cd.latest-folder.md) of an updated site. Configuration Manager requires you to use source files that match the version of the existing site that your new site will connect to.  

2.  On the **Before You Begin** page, choose **Next**.  

3.  On the **Getting Started** page, select the type of site that you want to install:  

    -   **Central administration site**, as the first site of a new hierarchy, or when expanding a stand-alone primary site:  

        Select **Install a Configuration Manager central administration site**.  

         During a later step of this procedure, you are offered the choice to install a central administration site as the first site of a new hierarchy, or to install a central administration site to expand on a stand-alone primary site.  

    -    **Primary site**, as a stand-alone primary site that is the first site of a new hierarchy, or as a child primary:  

        Select **Install a Configuration Manager primary site**.  

        > [!TIP]  
        > Typically, you only select the option **Use typical installation options for a stand-alone primary site** when you want to install a stand-alone primary site in a test environment. When you select this option, Setup:  

        > -   Automatically configures the site as a stand-alone primary site.  
        > -   Uses a default installation path.  
        > -   Uses a local installation of the default instance of SQL Server for the site database.  
        > -   Installs a management point and a distribution point on the site server computer.  
        > -   Configures the site with English and the display language of the operating system on the primary site server if it matches one of the languages that Configuration Manager supports.  

4.  On the **Product Key** page:
    - Choose whether to install Configuration Manager as an evaluation edition or a licensed edition.  

      -   If you select a licensed edition, enter your product key, and choose **Next**.  

      -   If you select an evaluation edition, choose **Next**. (You can upgrade an evaluation installation to a full installation later.)  
    - Beginning with the October 2016 release of version 1606 baseline media for System Center Configuration Manager, you can specify the expiration date of your Software Assurance agreement. On this page, you have the option to specify the **Software Assurance expiration date** of your licensing agreement as a convenient reminder to you of that date. If you don't enter this during Setup, you can specify it later from within the Configuration Manager console.

      > [!NOTE]   
      > Microsoft doesn't validate the expiration date that you entered and won't use this date for license validation. Instead, you can use it as a reminder of your expiration date. This is useful because Configuration Manager periodically checks for new software updates offered online â€” and your software assurance license status should be current so that you're eligible to use these additional updates.    

      For more information, see [Licensing and branches for System Center Configuration Manager](/sccm/core/understand/learn-more-editions).

5.  On the **Microsoft Software License Terms** page, read and accept the license terms.  

6.  On the **Prerequisite Licenses** page, read and accept the license terms for the prerequisite software. Setup downloads and automatically installs the software on site systems or clients when it's required. You must check all the boxes before you can continue to the next page.  

7.  On the **Prerequisite Downloads** page, specify whether Setup must download the latest prerequisite redistributable files from the Internet or use previously downloaded files:  

    -   If you want Setup to download the files at this time, select **Download required files** and specify a location to store the files in.  

    -   If you previously downloaded the files by using [Setup Downloader](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/setup-downloader.md), select **Use previously downloaded files** and specify the download folder.  

        > [!TIP]  
        > If you use previously downloaded files, verify that the path to the download folder contains the most recent version of the files.  

8.  On the **Server Language Selection** page, select the languages that are available for the Configuration Manager console and for reports. (English is selected by default and can't be removed.)  

9. On the **Client Language Selection** page, select the languages that are available to client computers, and specify whether to enable all client languages for mobile device clients. (English is selected by default and can't be removed.)  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > When you use a central administration site, ensure that client languages you configure at the central administration site include all client languages that you configure at each child primary site. This is because clients that install from a distribution point have access to the client languages from the top-tier site, while clients that install from a management point have access to the client languages from their assigned primary site.  

10. On the **Site and Installation Settings** page, specify the following for the new site that you're installing:  

    -   **Site code:** [Each site code in a hierarchy must be unique](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/prepare-to-install-sites.md#bkmk_sitecodes) and comprised of three alpha-numeric digits (A through Z and 0 through 9). Because the site code is used in folder names, don't use Windows-reserved names for the site, including:    
        -   AUX  
        -   CON    
        -   NUL    
        -   PRN    
        -   SMS  

        > [!NOTE]  
        > Setup doesn't verify whether the site code that you specify is already in use, or if it has a reserved name.  

    -   **Site name:** Each site requires this friendly name, which can help you identify the site.  

    -   **Installation folder:** This is the folder path to the Configuration Manager installation. You can't change the location after the site installs. Also, the path can't contain Unicode characters or trailing spaces.  

11. On the **Site Installation** page, use the following option that matches your scenario:  

    -   **I am installing a central administration site:**  

         On the **Central Administration Site Installation** page, select **Install as the first site in a new hierarchy**, and then choose **Next** to continue.  

    -   **I am expanding a stand-alone primary into a hierarchy with a central administration site:**  

         On the **Central Administration Site Installation** page, select **Expand an existing stand-alone primary into a hierarchy**, specify the FQDN of the stand-alone primary site server, and then choose **Next** to continue.  

         The media that you use to install the new central administration site must match the version of the primary site.  

    -   **I am installing a stand-alone primary site:**  

         On the **Primary Site Installation** page, select **Install the primary site as a stand-alone site**, and then choose **Next**.  

    -   **I am installing a child primary site:**  

         On the **Primary Site Installation** page, select **Join the primary site to an existing hierarchy**, specify the FQDN for the central administration site, and then choose **Next**.  

12. On the **Database Information** page, specify the following information:  

    -   **SQL Server name (FQDN):** By default, this is set to be the site server computer.

     If you use a custom port, add that port to the FQDN of the SQL Server. To do so, follow the FQDN of the sequel server with a comma and then the port number.   For example, for server *SQLServer1.fabrikam.com*, use the following to specify port *1551*:  **SQLServer1.fabrikam.com,1551**

    -   **Instance name:** By default, this is blank. It uses the default instance of SQL on the site server computer.  

    -   **Database name:** By default, this is set to CM_&lt;Sitecode\>. You are free to use a different name that you specify.  

    -   **Service Broker Port:** By default, this is set to use the default SQL Server Service Broker (SSB) port of 4022. SQL uses it to communicate directly to the site database at other sites.  

13. On the second **Database Information** page, you can specify nondefault locations for the SQL Server data file and the SQL Server log file for the site database:  

    -   Default file locations for SQL Server are provided.  

    -   The option to specify nondefault file locations isn't available when you use a SQL Server cluster.  

    -   The prerequisite checker doesn't run a check for free disk space for nondefault file locations.  

14. On the **SMS Provider Settings** page, specify the FQDN for the server where you want to install the SMS Provider.  

    -   By default, the site server is specified.  

    -   After the site installs, you can configure additional SMS Providers.  

15. On the **Client Communication Settings** page, choose whether to configure all site systems to accept only HTTPS communication from clients or for the communication method to be configured for each site system role.  

    When you select **All site system roles accept only HTTPS communication from clients**, the client computer must have a valid PKI certificate for client authentication. For more information about PKI certificate requirements, see [PKI Certificate Requirements for Configuration Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg699362.aspx).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This step only applies when you install a primary site. If you're installing a central administration site, skip this step.  

16. On the **Site System Roles** page, choose whether to install a management point or distribution point. For each role that you choose to have installed by Setup:  

    -   You must enter the **FQDN** for the computer that will host the role, and choose the client connection method that the server will support (HTTP or HTTPS).  

    -   If you selected **All site system roles accept only HTTPS communication from clients** on the previous page, the client connection settings are automatically configured for HTTPS and can't be changed unless you go back and change the setting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This step only applies when you install a primary site. If you're installing a central administration site, skip this step.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To install site system roles, Setup uses the **site system installation account**. By default, this uses the primary siteâ€™s computer account. This account must be a local administrator on a remote computer to install the site system role. If this account lacks the required permissions, uncheck the site system roles and install them later from within the Configuration Manager console, after configuring additional accounts to use as site system installation accounts.  

17. On the **Usage Data** page, review the information about data that Microsoft collects, and then choose **Next**.  

18. The **Service Connection Point Setup** page is only available during Setup:  

    -   When you're installing a stand-alone primary site.  

    -   When you're installing a central administration site.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you're installing a child primary site, skip this step (this page isn't available).  

     If you're installing a central administration site as part of a site expansion scenario and this role is already installed at the stand-alone primary site, you must uninstall this role from the stand-alone primary site. Only one instance of this role is permitted in a hierarchyâ€”and it's only permitted at the top-tier site of the hierarchy.  

     After you select a configuration for the **Service Connection Point**, choose **Next**. (After Setup completes, you can change this configuration from within the Configuration Manager console.)  

19. On the **Settings Summary** page, review the setting that you've selected. When you're ready, choose **Next** to start the Prerequisite Checker.  

20. On the **Prerequisite Installation Check** page, any problems that can be identified are listed.  

    -   When the Prerequisite Checker finds a problem, choose an item in the list for details about how to resolve the problem.  

    -   You must resolve each item with a status of **Failed** before you continue to install the site. Items with a status of **Warning** should be resolved, but they don't block the installation of the site.  

    -   After resolving issues, choose **Run Check** to rerun the Prerequisite Checker.  

     When the Prerequisite Checker runs and no checks receive a **Failed** status, you can choose **Begin Install** to start the site installation.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > In addition to the feedback that is provided in the wizard, you can find additional information about prerequisite issues when you view the **ConfigMgrPrereq.log** file in the root of the system drive of the computer you're installing on. For a list of installation prerequisite rules and descriptions, see [List of Prerequisite Checks for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/list-of-prerequisite-checks.md).  

21. On the **Installation** page, Setup displays the installation status. When the core site server installation is complete, you'll have the option to **Close** the installation wizard. When you close the wizard, the installation and initial site configurations continue in the background.  

    -   You can connect a Configuration Manager console to the site before Setup is complete. This console connects as read-only, and lets you view objects and settings, but you can't introduce edits.  

    -   After Setup completes, you'll be able to connect a console that can edit objects and settings.  


## <a name="bkmk_expand"></a> Expand a stand-alone primary site
When you've installed a stand-alone primary site as your first site, you have the option later to expand that site into a larger hierarchy by installing a central administration site.   

When you expand a stand-alone primary site, you install a new central administration site that uses the existing stand-alone primary site database as a reference. After the new central administration site installs, the stand-alone primary site functions as a child primary site.

-   Only a stand-alone primary site can be expanded into a new hierarchy.  

-   Only one stand-alone primary site can be expanded into a specific hierarchy. You can't use this option to join additional stand-alone primary sites into the same hierarchy. Instead, use Migration to migrate data from one hierarchy into another.  

-   After you expand a stand-alone site into a hierarchy with a central administration site, you can add additional child primary child sites.  

-   To remove a primary site from a hierarchy with a central administration site, you must uninstall the primary site.  

To expand the site, you use the System Center Configuration Manager Setup Wizard to install a new central administration site with the following caveats:  

-   You must install the central administration site by using the same version of Configuration Manager as the stand-alone primary site.  

-   On the **Getting Started** page of the Setup Wizard, you select the option to install a central administration site. At a later stage of Setup, you'll choose an option to expand an existing stand-alone primary site.  

-   When you configure the **Client Language Selection** page for the new central administration site, you must select the same client languages that are configured for the stand-alone primary site that you're expanding.  

-   On the **Site Installation** page, you select the option to expand the stand-alone primary site.  

To expand a stand-alone primary site, first see the [prerequisites to expand a site](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/install/prerequisites-for-installing-sites#bkmk_expand), and then use the procedure *[To install a primary or central administration site](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/use-the-setup-wizard-to-install-sites.md#bkmk_installpri)*, earlier in this article.


## <a name="bkmk_secondary"></a> Install a secondary site
 You use the Configuration Manager console to install a secondary site.  

-   If the console you use isn't connected to the primary site that will be the parent site to the new secondary site, the command to install the site will be replicated to the correct primary site.  

-   Before starting the site installation, ensure that your user account has the prerequisite permissions, and that the computer that will host the new secondary site meets all the prerequisites for use as a secondary site server.  

-   When you install the secondary site, Configuration Manager configures the new site to use the client communication ports that are configured at the parent primary site.  

### <a name="bkmk_installsecondary"></a> To install a secondary site  


1.  In the Configuration Manager console, navigate to **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites**. Select the site that will be the parent primary site of the new secondary site.  

2.  Choose **Create Secondary Site** to start the **Create Secondary Site Wizard**.  

3.  On the **Before You Begin** page, confirm that the primary site that is listed is the site that you want to be the parent of the new secondary site. Then choose **Next**.  

4.  On the **General** page, specify the following:  

    -   **Site code**: Each site code in a hierarchy must be unique and comprised of three alpha-numeric digits (A through Z and 0 through 9). Because the site code is used in folder names, don't use Windows-reserved names for the site, including:  

        -   AUX    
        -   CON    
        -   NUL    
        -   PRN  
        -   SMS  

       > [!NOTE]  
       > Setup doesn't verify whether the site code that you specify is already in use, or if it's a reserved name.  

    -   **Site server name**: This is the FQDN of the server where the new secondary site will install.  

    -   **Site name**: Each site requires this friendly name, which can help you identify the site.  

    -   **Installation folder**: This is the folder path to the Configuration Manager installation. You can't change the location after the site installs. The path can't contain Unicode characters or trailing spaces.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > After you specify details on this page, you can choose **Summary** to use the default settings for the remainder of the secondary site options, and to go directly to the **Summary** page of the wizard.  

    > -   Only use this option when you're familiar with the default settings in this wizard, and they are the settings you want to use.  
    > -   Boundary groups aren't associated with the distribution point when you use the default settings. Therefore, until you configure boundary groups that include the secondary site server, clients won't use the distribution point that is installed on this secondary site as a content source location.  

5.  On the **Installation Source Files** page, choose how the secondary site computer obtains source files for installing the site.  

     When you use source files that are stored on the network or stored on the secondary site computer:  

    -   The source file location must include a folder named **Redist** that includes all the files that were previously downloaded by using Setup Downloader.  

    -   If any of the files from **Redist** aren't available, Setup will fail to install the secondary site.  

    -   The computer account of the secondary site computer must have **Read** permissions to the source file folder and share.  

6.  On the **SQL Server Settings** page, specify the version of SQL Server to use, and then configure related settings.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Setup doesn't validate the information that you enter on this page until it starts the installation. Before you continue, verify these settings.  

     **Install and configure a local copy of SQL Express on the secondary site computer**  

    -   **SQL Server Service port**: Specify the SQL Server service port for SQL Server Express to use. The service port is typically configured to use TCP port 1433, but you can configure another port.  

    -   **SQL Server Broker port**: Specify the SQL Server Service Broker (SSB) port for SQL Server Express to use. The Service Broker is typically configured to use TCP port 4022, but you can configure a different port. You must specify a valid port that no other site or service is using, and that no firewall restrictions are blocking.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > When Configuration Manager installs SQL Server Express, it installs SQL Server Express 2012 with no service pack:  

    > -   For the secondary site to be supported, after it installs, you must upgrade SQL Server Express 2012 to [a supported version](/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/support-for-sql-server-versions#bkmk_SQLVersions).
    > -   Additionally, if the new secondary site installation fails to finish but first completes the installation of SQL Server Express 2012, you must update that instance of SQL Server Express before Configuration Manager can successfully retry the secondary site installation.  

     **Use an existing SQL Server instance**  

    -   **SQL Server FQDN**: Review the FQDN for the computer running SQL Server. You must use a local server running SQL Server to host the secondary site database, and you can't modify this setting.  

    -   **SQL Server instance**: Specify the instance of SQL Server to use as the secondary site database. Leave this option blank to use the default instance.  

    -   **ConfigMgr site database name**: Specify the name to use for the secondary site database.  

    -   **SQL Server Broker port**: Specify the SQL Server Service Broker (SSB) port for SQL Server to use. You must specify a valid port that no other site or service is using, and that no firewall restrictions block.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > See [Supported SQL Server versions](../../../../core/plan-design/configs/support-for-sql-server-versions.md) for a list of the SQL Server versions that System Center Configuration Manager supports.  

7.  On the **Distribution Point** page, configure settings for the distribution point that will be installed on the secondary site server.  

     **Required settings:**  

    -   **Specify how client devices communicate with the distribution point**: Choose between HTTP and HTTPS.  

    -   **Create a self-signed certificate or import a PKI client certificate**: Choose between using a self-signed certificate (which lets you also allow anonymous connections from Configuration Manager clients to the content library) or importing a certificate from your PKI.  

         The certificate is used to authenticate the distribution point to a management point before the distribution point sends status messages.  

         For information about the certificate requirements, see [PKI Certificate Requirements for Configuration Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg699362.aspx).  

    **Optional settings:**  

    -   **Install and configure IIS if required by Configuration Manager**: Select this setting to let Configuration Manager install and configure Internet Information Services (IIS) on the server if it's not already installed. IIS must be installed on all distribution points.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        > Although this setting is optional, IIS must be installed on the server before a distribution point can be installed successfully.  

    -   **Enable and configure BranchCache for this distribution point**.  

    -   **Description**. This is a friendly description for the distribution point to help you recognize it.  

    -   **Enable this distribution point for prestaged content**.  

8.  On the **Drive Settings** page, specify the drive settings for the secondary site distribution point.  

     You can configure up to two disk drives for the content library and two disk drives for the package share. However, Configuration Manager can use additional drives when the first two reach the configured drive space reserve. The **Drive Settings** page is where you configure the priority for the disk drives and the amount of free disk space to remain on each disk drive.  

    -   **Drive space reserve (MB)**: The value that you configure for this setting determines the amount of free space on a drive before Configuration Manager chooses a different drive and continues the copy process to that drive. Content files can span multiple drives.  

    -   **Content Locations**: Specify the content locations for the content library and package share. Configuration Manager copies content to the primary content location until the amount of free space reaches the value that is specified for **Drive space reserve (MB)**.

     By default, the content locations are set to **Automatic**. The primary content location is set to the disk drive that has the most disk space at installation time. The secondary location is set to the disk drive that has the most free disk space after the primary drive. When the primary and secondary drives reach the drive space reserve, Configuration Manager selects another available drive with the most free disk space and continues the copy process.  

9. On the **Content Validation** page, specify whether to validate the integrity of content files on the distribution point.  

    -   When you enable content validation on a schedule, Configuration Manager initiates the process at the scheduled time, and all content on the distribution point is verified.  

    -   You can also configure the **Content validation priority**.  

    -   To view the results of the content validation process, in the Configuration Manager console, navigate to **Monitoring** > **Distribution Status** > **Content Status**. The content for each package type (for example, Application, Software Update Package, and Boot Image) is displayed.  

10. On the **Boundary Groups** page, manage the boundary groups that this distribution point is assigned to:  

    -   During content deployment, clients must be in a boundary group that is associated with the distribution point to use it as a source location for content.  

    -   You can select the **Allow fallback source location for content** option to allow clients outside these boundary groups to fall back and use the distribution point as a source location for content when no preferred distribution points are available.  

     For information about preferred distribution points, see the [Fundamental concepts for content management](../../../../core/plan-design/hierarchy/fundamental-concepts-for-content-management.md) topic.  

11. On the **Summary** page, verify the settings, and then choose **Next** to install the secondary site. When the wizard presents the **Completion** page, you can close the wizard. The secondary site installation continues in the background.  


### <a name="bkmk_verify"></a> To verify the secondary site installation status  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, navigate to **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites**.  

2.  Select the secondary site server that you're installing, and then choose **Show Install Status**.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > When you install more than one secondary site at a time, the Prerequisite Checker runs against a single site at a time and must finish a site before it starts to check the next site.
