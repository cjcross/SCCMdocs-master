# Command-line options for Setup in System Center Configuration Manager*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

 Use the following information to configure scripts or to install System Center Configuration Manager from a command line.  

##  <a name="bkmk_setup"></a> Command-line options for Setup  
 **/DEINSTALL**  
 Uninstalls the site. You must run Setup from the site server computer.  

 **/DONTSTARTSITECOMP**  
 Installs a site, but prevents the Site Component Manager service from starting. Until the Site Component Manager service starts, the site is not active. The Site Component Manager is responsible for installing and starting the SMS_Executive service, and for additional processes at the site. After the site install is finished, when you start the Site Component Manager service, it installs the SMS_Executive service and additional processes that are necessary for the site to operate.  

 **/HIDDEN**  
 Hides the user interface during Setup. Use this option only in conjunction with the **/SCRIPT** option. The unattended script file must provide all required options or Setup fails.  

 **/NOUSERINPUT**  
 Disables user input during Setup, but displays the Setup Wizard. Use this option only in conjunction with the **/SCRIPT** option. The unattended script file must provide all required options or Setup fails.  

 **/RESETSITE**  
 Performs a site reset that resets the database and service accounts for the site. You must run Setup from **<*Configuration Manager installation path*>\BIN\X64** on the site server. For more information about the site reset, see the [Run a site reset](../../../../core/servers/manage/modify-your-infrastructure.md#bkmk_reset) section in [Modify your System Center Configuration Manager infrastructure](../../../../core/servers/manage/modify-your-infrastructure.md).  

 **/TESTDBUPGRADE <*Instance name*>\\<*Database name*>**  
 Performs a test on a backup of the site database to ensure that the database is capable of an upgrade. You must provide the instance name and database name for the site database. If you specify only the database name, Setup uses the default instance name.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Do not run this command-line option on your production site database. Running this command-line option on your production site database upgrades the site database and could render your site inoperable.  

 **/UPGRADE**  
 Runs an unattended upgrade of a site. When you use **/UPGRADE**, you must specify the product key, including the dashes (-). Also, you must specify the path to the previously downloaded Setup prerequisite files.  

 Example: `setupwpf.exe /UPGRADE xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx <path to external component files>`  

 For more information about Setup prerequisite files, see  [Setup Downloader](setup-downloader.md).  

 **/SCRIPT <*Setup script path*>**  
 Performs unattended installations. A Setup initialization file is required when you use the **/SCRIPT** option. For more information about how to run Setup unattended, see [Install sites using a command line](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/use-a-command-line-to-install-sites.md).  

 **/SDKINST <*SMS Provider FQDN*>**  
 Installs the SMS Provider on the specified computer. You must provide the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the SMS Provider computer. For more information about the SMS Provider, see [Plan for the SMS Provider for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-the-sms-provider.md).  

 **/SDKDEINST <*SMS Provider FQDN*>**  
 Uninstalls the SMS Provider on the specified computer. You must provide the FQDN for the SMS Provider computer.  

 **/MANAGELANGS <*Language script path*>**  
 Manages the languages that are installed at a previously installed site. To use this option, you must run Setup from **<*Configuration Manager installation path*>\BIN\X64** on the site server and provide the location for the language script file that contains the language settings. For more information about the language options available in the language setup script file, see [Command-line options to manage languages](#bkmk_Lang) in this topic.
