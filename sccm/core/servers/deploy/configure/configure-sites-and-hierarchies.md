# Configure sites and hierarchies for System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

After you install your first System Center Configuration Manager site or add additional sites to your hierarchy, use the following checklist to ensure that you consider the most common configurations that affect both sites and hierarchies.  

## Checklist of common configurations for new and additional sites  
Keep in mind the following notes about configuration, which apply to most deployments:

-   Some options build upon each other, such as Active Directory Forest Discovery, boundaries, and boundary groups.  

-   Several configurations have default values you can use without configuration changes, at least temporarily.  

-   Other configurations, like boundary groups and distribution point groups, require you to configure them before you can use them.  

|Action|Details|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Configure role-based administration|Segregate administrative assignments to control which administrative users can view and manage different objects and data in your Configuration Manager environment.<br /><br /> Configurations for role-based administration are shared with all sites in a hierarchy.   <br/><br/>For more information, see [Configure role-based administration for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/configure-role-based-administration.md).|  
|Publish site data to Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)|Make it easy for clients to find services and efficiently use site resources.<br /><br /> You must first [extend the Active Directory schema for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/plan-design/network/extend-the-active-directory-schema.md), and then each site must be configured individually to [publish site data for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/publish-site-data.md)|  
|Configure a service connection point|Plan to install and configure the service connection point at the top-tier site of your hierarchy. For more information, see [About the service connection point in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-the-service-connection-point.md).|  
|Add site system roles|Install one or more additional site system roles for individual sites.  For more information, see [Add site system roles for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/add-site-system-roles.md).|  
|Configure site boundaries and boundary groups|Specify boundaries that define network locations on your intranet that can contain devices that you want to manage. Then configure boundary groups so that clients at those network locations can find Configuration Manager resources. For more information, see [Define site boundaries and boundary groups for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/define-site-boundaries-and-boundary-groups.md).|  
|Configure distribution point groups|Configure logical  groups of distribution points to make managing deployments easier. For more information, see [Manage distribution point groups](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/install-and-configure-distribution-points.md#bkmk_manage) in [Install and configure distribution points for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/install-and-configure-distribution-points.md).|  
|Run Discovery|Run Discovery to find resources on your network, including network infrastructure, devices, and users.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Run discovery for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/run-discovery.md).|  
|Add redundancy and capacity for administrators who manage your infrastructure|Install additional SMS providers and Configuration Manager consoles to expand capacity for administrators to manage your infrastructure:<br /><br /> **Install additional SMS providers** to provide redundancy for contact points to administer your site and hierarchy. For more information, see [Manage the SMS provider](../../../../core/servers/manage/modify-your-infrastructure.md#BKMK_ManageSMSprovider) in [Modify your System Center Configuration Manager infrastructure](../../../../core/servers/manage/modify-your-infrastructure.md).<br /><br /> **Install additional Configuration Manager consoles** to provide access to additional administrative users. For more information, see [Install Configuration Manager consoles](../../../../core/servers/deploy/install/install-consoles.md).|  
|Configure site components|Configure site components at each site to modify the behavior of site system roles and site status reporting. For more information, see [Site components for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/site-components.md).|  
|Create custom collections|Using information that was discovered about devices and users, create custom collections of objects to simplify future management tasks. For more information, see  [How to create collections in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections.md).|  
|Configure settings to manage high-risk deployments|Configure settings at a site that warns administrative users when they create a high-risk task sequence deployment.  For more information, see  [Settings to manage high-risk deployments for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../protect/understand/settings-to-manage-high-risk-deployments.md).|  
|Configure database replicas for management points|Configure a database replica to reduce the CPU load that's placed on the site database server by management points as they service requests from clients. For more information, see [Database replicas for management points for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/database-replicas-for-management-points.md).|  
|Configure a SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability group to host the site database|Beginning with version 1602, configure availability groups as high-availability and disaster-recovery solutions for hosting the site database at primary sites and the central administration site. For more information, see [SQL Server AlwaysOn for a highly available site database for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/sql-server-alwayson-for-a-highly-available-site-database.md).|  
|Modify replication between sites|See [Data transfers between sites in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/servers/manage/data-transfers-between-sites.md) to learn about the following subjects:<br /><br /> Configure [file-based replication](../../../../core/servers/manage/data-transfers-between-sites.md#bkmk_fileroute) between secondary sites<br /><br /> Configure [database replication links](../../../../core/servers/manage/data-transfers-between-sites.md#bkmk_Dblinks)<br /><br /> Configure [distributed views](../../../../core/servers/manage/data-transfers-between-sites.md#bkmk_distviews)|
