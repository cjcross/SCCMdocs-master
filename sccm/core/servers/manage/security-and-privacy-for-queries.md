# Security and privacy for queries in System Center Configuration Manager*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*
Queries in System Center Configuration Manager let you retrieve information from the site database based on the criteria that you specify. Configuration Manager collects the site database information during standard operation. For example, by using information that has been collected from discovery or inventory, you can configure a query to identify devices that meet specified criteria.  

 For more information about queries, see [Introduction to queries in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/servers/manage/introduction-to-queries.md). For more information about security best practices and privacy information for Configuration Manager operations that collect the information that you can retrieve by using queries, see [Security and privacy for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/plan-design/security/security-and-privacy.md).
