**Delete Inactive Client Discovery Data**: Use this task to delete discovery data for inactive clients from the database. Clients are marked as inactive when the client is flagged as obsolete and by configurations that are made for client status.

This task operates only on resources that are Configuration Manager clients. It's different than the **Delete Aged Discovery Data** task, which deletes any aged discovery data record. When this task runs at a site, it removes the data from the database at all sites in a hierarchy. For more information, see [How to configure client status in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/clients/deploy/configure-client-status.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When it's enabled, configure this task to run at an interval greater than the **Heartbeat Discovery** schedule. This enables active clients to send a Heartbeat Discovery record to mark their client record as active so this task doesn't delete them.  

-   Central administration site: Not available    
-   **Primary site**: Not enabled    
-   Secondary site: Not available  

**Delete Obsolete Alerts**: Use this task to delete expired alerts that have been stored longer than a specified time from the database.

-   **Central administration site**: Enabled    
-   **Primary site**: Enabled    
-   Secondary site: Not available  

**Delete Obsolete Client Discovery Data**: Use this task to delete obsolete client records from the database. A record that is marked as obsolete has usually been replaced by a newer record for the same client. The newer record becomes the client's current record. For information about Discovery, see [Run discovery for System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/servers/deploy/configure/run-discovery.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When it's enabled, configure this task to run at an interval greater than the Heartbeat Discovery schedule. This enables the client to send a Heartbeat Discovery record that sets the obsolete status correctly.  

-   Central administration site: Not available

**Monitor Keys**: Use this task to monitor the integrity of the Configuration Manager database primary keys. A primary key is a column (or a combination of columns) that uniquely identifies one row and distinguishes it from any other row in a Microsoft SQL Server database table.  

-   **Central administration site**: Enabled    
-   **Primary site**: Enabled    
-   Secondary site: Not available  

**Rebuild Indexes**: Use this task to rebuild the Configuration Manager database indexes. An index is a database structure that is created on a database table to speed up data retrieval. For example, searching an indexed column is often much faster than searching a column that isn't indexed.

To improve performance, the Configuration Manager database indexes are frequently updated to remain synchronized with the constantly changing data that is stored in the database. This task creates indexes on database columns that are at least 50 percent unique, drops indexes on columns that are less than 50 percent unique, and rebuilds all existing indexes that meet the data uniqueness criteria.

**Update Application Available Targeting**: Use this task to have Configuration Manager recalculate the mapping of policy and application deployments to resources in collections. When you deploy policy or applications to a collection, Configuration Manager creates an initial mapping between the objects that you deploy and the collection members.

These mappings are stored in a table for quick reference. When a collections membership changes, these stored mappings are updated to reflect those changes. However, it's possible for these mappings to fall out of sync. For example, if the site fails to properly process a notification file, that change might not be reflected in a change to the mappings. This task refreshes that mapping based on current collection membership.
