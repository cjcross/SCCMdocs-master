# Technical Preview for System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Technical Preview)*

**Welcome to the System Center Configuration Manager Technical Preview**. This topic provides details about the evolving preview release that introduces new functionality and capabilities we are working on. With each version of the technical preview, new features are introduced that are not included in the current branch of System Center Configuration Manager at the time the technical preview version is made available. These features might eventually be included in an update to the current branch release, but before we finalize the features and add them, we want you to have a chance to try them out and give us feedback.  

 Because this is a technical preview, details and functionality are subject to change.  

 This topic contains information that applies to all versions of the Technical Preview, and also  lists each new capability (or feature) along with the  Technical Preview version in which the capability first appears, like version 1710 for October of 2017. The details for these capabilities are detailed in  separate topics dedicated to each preview version.  

 For information about what's new in the current branch of Configuration Manager, see [What's new in System Center Configuration Manager](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/what-has-changed-from-configuration-manager-2012).



##  <a name="bkmk_reqs"></a> Requirements and limitations for the Technical Preview  

> [!IMPORTANT]     
>  The Technical Preview is licensed for use only in a lab environment.  Microsoft may not provide support services and certain features may not be available in the Preview software. Additionally, the Preview software may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability and reliability standards relative to commercially provided software.  

 For most product prerequisites, use the information in the [Supported configurations for System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/plan-design/configs/supported-configurations.md). The following exceptions apply to the Technical Preview releases:  

-   Each install remains active for 90 days before it becomes inactive.  

-   English is the only language supported.


-   Only the following install flags (switches) are supported:  

    -   **/silent**  
    -   **/testdbupgrade**    


-   By default, when you use the technical preview, the service connection point is set to online mode when it installs, and does not support a change to offline mode.

-   When applicable, additional limitations or requirements are included with details for each specific version of the Technical Preview  

-   There is no support for migration to or from this preview build.  

-   There is no support for upgrade to this preview build.  

-   There is no support for upgrade to a production build (current branch) from this preview build. However, when updates are available for a preview version,  you can find and install them from the **Updates and Servicing** node of the Configuration Manager console. For a video of the in-console upgrade process, see [Installing ConfigMgr Update Packages](https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBd_EGFbUT8) on youtube.com.  
-   Only a stand-alone primary site is supported. There is no support for a central administration site, multiple primary sites, or secondary sites.  

The following products and technologies are supported by this branch of Configuration Manager. However, their inclusion in this content does not imply an extension of support for a product or version that is beyond that product's individual support lifecycle. Products that are beyond their support lifecycle are not supported for use with Configuration Manager. For more information about Microsoft Support Lifecycles, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=208270) website.  

-   Only the following versions of SQL Server are supported:  

    -   SQL Server 2016 (with no Service Pack, and later)
    -   SQL Server 2014 (with Service Pack 1, and later)
    -   SQL Server 2012 (with Service Pack 3, or later)


-   The site supports up to 10 clients, which must run one of the following:  

      -   Windows 10  
      -   Windows 8.1  
      -   Windows 8  
      -   Windows 7  

##  <a name="bkmk_install"></a> Install and update the Technical Preview  
 The System Center Configuration Manager Technical Preview is distinct from the current release of System Center Configuration Manager.  

 To use the technical preview you must first install a **baseline version** of the technical preview build. After installing a baseline version, you then use **in-console updates** to bring your installation up to date with the most recent preview version. Typically, new versions of the Technical Preview are available each month.

Each preview release is supported up until three successive releases are available. Meaning, when version 1708 releases, version 1704 would no longer be in support, but versions 1705, 1706, and 1707 would remain in support. When a baseline falls out of support (like version 1703), it is still supported for installing a new Technical Preview site until a new baseline version is available, so long as you then update that install to a supported version. When updating, if you donâ€™t see the most recent version available in your console, update to the latest version offered and then repeat that process until you can install the most current version of the technical preview.

> [!TIP]  
>  When you install  an update to the  technical preview, you  update your preview installation to that new technical preview version.    A technical preview installation  never has the option to upgrade to a current branch installation, nor  receive updates from the current branch release.  

**Active baseline versions of the Technical Preview:**  
You can install a baseline version for up to 1 year after its release. However, when you install a new technical preview site, we recommend you use the latest baseline version that is available.
-  **Technical Preview 1711** - The Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1711 is available as both an in-console update for the Configuration Manager Technical Preview, and as a new baseline version that is [available from the TechNet Evaluation Center website](http://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-system-center-configuration-manager-and-endpoint-protection-technical-preview).
-  **Technical Preview 1703** - The Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1703 is available as both an in-console update for the Configuration Manager Technical Preview, and as a baseline version. If you are installing a new baseline, we recommend you use version 1711.
