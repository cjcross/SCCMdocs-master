# Endpoint Protection

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Endpoint Protection in System Center Configuration Manager lets you to manage antimalware policies and Windows Firewall security for client computers in your Configuration Manager hierarchy.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must be licensed to use Endpoint Protection to manage clients in your Configuration Manager hierarchy.  

 When you use Endpoint Protection with Configuration Manager, you have the following benefits:  

-   Configure antimalware policies, Windows Firewall settings, and manage Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection to selected groups of computers  
-   Use Configuration Manager software updates to download the latest antimalware definition files to keep client computers up-to-date  
-   Send email notifications, use in-console monitoring, and view reports to keep administrative users informed when malware is detected on client computers  

Beginning with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 computers, Windows Defender is already installed. For these operating systems, a management client for Windows Defender is installed when the Configuration Manager client installs. On Windows 8.1 and earlier computers, the Endpoint Protection client is installed with the Configuration Manager client. Windows Defender and the Endpoint Protection client have the following capabilities:  

-   Malware and spyware detection and remediation  
-   Rootkit detection and remediation  
-   Critical vulnerability assessment and automatic definition and engine updates  
-   Network vulnerability detection through Network Inspection System  
-   Integration with Cloud Protection Service to report malware to Microsoft. When you join this service, the Endpoint Protection client or Windows Defender can download the latest definitions from the Malware Protection Center when unidentified malware is detected on a computer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The Endpoint Protection client can be installed on a server that runs Hyper-V and on guest virtual machines with supported operating systems. To prevent excessive CPU usage, Endpoint Protection actions have a built-in randomized delay so that protection services do not run simultaneously.  

 In addition, Endpoint Protection in Configuration Manager lets you to manage Windows Firewall settings in the Configuration Manager console.

## Managing Malware with Endpoint Protection  
 Endpoint Protection in Configuration Manager allows you to create antimalware policies that contain settings for Endpoint Protection client configurations. You can then deploy these antimalware policies to client computers and monitor them in the **Endpoint Protection Status** node under **Security** in the **Monitoring** workspace, or by using Configuration Manager reports.

## Managing Windows Firewall with Endpoint Protection  
 Endpoint Protection in Configuration Manager provides basic management of the Windows Firewall on client computers. For each network profile, you can configure the following settings:  

-   Enable or disable the Windows Firewall.  

-   Block incoming connections, including those in the list of allowed programs.  

-   Notify the user when Windows Firewall blocks a new program.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Endpoint Protection supports managing the Windows Firewall only.  


 For more information about how to create and deploy Windows Firewall policies for Endpoint Protection, see [How to create and deploy Windows Firewall policies for Endpoint Protection in System Center Configuration Manager](create-windows-firewall-policies.md).  


## Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection

Starting with version 1606 of Configuration Manager (current branch), Endpoint Protection can help manage and monitor Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). Windows Defender ATP is a new service that will help enterprises to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks on their networks. See [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).

## Endpoint Protection Workflow  
 Use the following diagram to help you understand the workflow to implement Endpoint Protection in your Configuration Manager hierarchy.

## Endpoint Protection Client for Mac Computers and Linux Servers  
 System Center Endpoint Protection includes an Endpoint Protection client for Linux and for Mac computers. These clients are not supplied with Configuration Manager; instead, you must download the following products from the [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).  

-   System Center Endpoint Protection for the Mac  

-   System Center Endpoint Protection for Linux  


> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must be a Microsoft Volume License customer to download the Endpoint Protection installation files for Linux and the Mac.  

 These products cannot be managed from the Configuration Manager console. However, a System Center Operations Manager management pack is supplied with the installation files, which allows you to manage the client for Linux by using Operations Manager.
