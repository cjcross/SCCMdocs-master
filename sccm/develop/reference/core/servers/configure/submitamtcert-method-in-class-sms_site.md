# SubmitAMTCert Method in Class SMS_Site
The `SubmitAMTCert` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, submits a certificate for a computer that implements Intel Active Management Technology (Intel AMT).  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 SubmitAMTCert(    
     String Certificate,    
     String Password,    
     SInt32 Type  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `Certificate`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in, optional]  

 Hexadecimal-encoded certificate.  

 `Password`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in, optional]  

 The password for Personal Information Exchange (PFX) Certificate, if needed.  

 `Type`  
 Data type: `SInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in, optional]  

 The type of certificate. If omitted, the default value is `4`. Possible values are:  

|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|4|Root certificate. Currently unimplemented.|  
|5|Provisioning certificate. Indicates that this certificate will be used by an Out of Band service point provisioning server to authenticate Intel AMT firmware during Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshaking|  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
