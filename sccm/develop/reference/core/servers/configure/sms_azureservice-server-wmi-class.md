# SMS_AzureService Server WMI Class
The `SMS_AzureService` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents an Windows Azure service which is a Cloud Distribution Point for Configuration Manager.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_AzureService : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AzureServiceID;  
    String DeploymentSlot;  
    String Description;  
    UInt32 Flags;  
    String Fqdn;  
    String ManagementCertificate;  
    UInt32 ManagementCertificateType;  
    String ManagementThumbprint;  
    String NALPath;  
    String Name;  
    UInt32 NumberOfInstances;  
    String Region;  
    String ServiceCertificate;  
    String ServiceCName;  
    String ServiceThumbprint;  
    String ServiceThumbprintAlgorithm;  
    String ServiceType;  
    String SiteCode;  
    UInt32 State;  
    UInt32 StatusDetails;  
    UInt32 StorageCriticalThreshold;  
    Boolean StorageQuotaGrow;  
    UInt32 StorageQuotaInGB;

    UInt32 TrafficCriticalThreshold;  
    UInt32 TrafficOutInGB;  
    Boolean TrafficOutStopService;  
    UInt32 TrafficOutUsage;  
    UInt32 TrafficWarningThreshold;  
};  
```
