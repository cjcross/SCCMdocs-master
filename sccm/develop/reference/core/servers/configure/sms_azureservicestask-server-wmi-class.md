# SMS_AzureServicesTask Server WMI Class
The `SMS_AzureServicesTask` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents an Windows Azure specific operation which can be performed on the specified Windows Azure Service. This can be used to initiate an operation as well as monitor the results of the operation.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_AzureServicesTask : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AzureServiceId;  
    String SiteCode;  
    DateTime TaskCreationTime;  
    DateTime TaskEndTime;  
    UInt32 TaskID;  
    String TaskKeyValue;  
    UInt32 TaskStateId;  
    UInt32 TaskTypeId;  
    UInt32 Type;  
};  
```
