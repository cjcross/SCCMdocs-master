# ICcmAlternateDownloadProvider : Resume Method
The **ICcmAlternateDownloadProvider::Resume** method, in Configuration Manager, instructs the provider to resume a given job.  

## Syntax  

```  
HRESULT Resume(  
            REFGUID JobID  
    );  

```  

#### Parameters  
 `JobID`  
 Data type: `REFGUID`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The job on which to take action.  

## Remarks  

> [!NOTE]
>  The provider must support Resume being called on a job that is not suspended. In that case, it should simply do nothing and not report an error. An error should be returned if the job is not found or if resuming failed.  

## Return Values  
 An `HRESULT` code. Possible values include, but are not limited to, the following:  

 S_OK  
 Success implies that discovery was triggered successfully. All other return values indicate failure.
