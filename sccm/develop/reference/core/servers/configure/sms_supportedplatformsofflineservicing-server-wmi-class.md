# SMS_SupportedPlatformsOfflineServicing Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SupportedPlatformsOfflineServicing` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that used to determine which operating system images can be serviced offline.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SupportedPlatformsOfflineServicing : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    String Name;  
    String OsVersionBuild;  
    String ProductType;  
};  
```
