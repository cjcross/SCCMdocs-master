# CCM_DTS_PRIORITY Enumeration
The **CCM_DTS_PRIORITY** enumeration indicates the priority of the download.  

## Syntax  

```  
typedef enum  
{  
    CCM_DTS_PRIORITY_FOREGROUND,   
    CCM_DTS_PRIORITY_HIGH,   
    CCM_DTS_PRIORITY_NORMAL,   
    CCM_DTS_PRIORITY_LOW,   
}CCM_DTS_PRIORITY;  

```  

## Members  

|||  
|-|-|  
|CCM_DTS_PRIORITY_FOREGROUND|The highest priority.|  
|CCM_DTS_PRIORITY_HIGH|High priority.|  
|CCM_DTS_PRIORITY_NORMAL|Normal priority.|  
|CCM_DTS_PRIORITY_LOW|Low priority.|  

## Remarks  
 The only strict requirement is that jobs at a lower priority do not block progress of jobs at a higher priority. It is possible in certain NAP-related scenarios that lower priority jobs may be blocked on content needed for remediation that are in higher priority jobs. Providers must respect this.
