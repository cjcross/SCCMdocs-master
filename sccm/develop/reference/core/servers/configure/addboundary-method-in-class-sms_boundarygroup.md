# AddBoundary Method in Class SMS_BoundaryGroup
The `AddBoundary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, adds boundaries to this boundary group.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 AddBoundary(  
   UInt32 BoundaryID[]  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `BoundaryID`  
 Data type: `UInt32` Array  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Unique identifier of the boundary.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).
