# CCM_SoftwareUpdatesManager Client WMI Class
The `CCM_SoftwareUpdatesManager` WMI class is a client class, in Configuration Manager, that exposes methods to install, schedule and other actions on set of software updates.  

 This interface is equivalent to the ICCMUpdatesDeployment COM interface in the Configuration Manager 2007 SDK.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The software update client side SDK will only return set of updates which are deployed to client from Configuration Manager site server, and are applicable, and are yet to be installed on the client.  

 The following syntax is simplified from the Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
class CCM_SoftwareUpdatesManager();  
```
