# AMTOperateForCollection Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `AMTOperateForCollection` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, executes an Intel Active Management (AMT) operation on a collection.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 AMTOperateForCollection(     
     UInt32 Opcode  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `Opcode`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The AMT operation to execute. The following table provides the list of supported actions:  

|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|1|WakeUp: Brings a sleeping computer back into the powered-on state.|  
|2|Restart: Causes a hard reset of the computer and the computer is then powered on. This does not shut the operating system down.|  
|3|Shutdown: Causes a hard reset of the computer. This does not shut the operating system down.|  
|8|DiscoveryBMC: Detects the AMT capability from an Out of Band service point. This populates the AMTStatus and AMTFullVersion properties of the corresponding SMS_R_System record.|  
|16|ReinventoryBMC: Currently unimplemented.|  
|8192|ClearAuditLog: Clears the audit log entries.|  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
