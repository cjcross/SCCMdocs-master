# AddType Method in Class SMS_UserMachineRelationship
The `AddType` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in System Center Configuration Manager, adds a type of the relationship between a user and a device.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and is intended to show the definition of the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 AddType(  
     uint32 TypeId  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `TypeId`  
 Data type: `UInt32` Array  

 Qualifiers: `[in]`  

 TypeId â€¦.   

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
