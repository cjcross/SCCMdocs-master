# AddSource Method in Class SMS_UserMachineRelationship
The `AddSource` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in System Center Configuration Manager, adds a source for the relationship between the user and the device.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 AddSource(  
     uint32 SourceId  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `SourceId`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: `[in]`  

 Source object identifier for dependency.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
