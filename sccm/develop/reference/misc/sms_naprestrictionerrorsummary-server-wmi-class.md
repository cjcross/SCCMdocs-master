# SMS_NAPRestrictionErrorSummary Server WMI Class
The `SMS_NAPRestrictionErrorSummary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a Network Access Protection (NAP) restriction error summary.  

> [!NOTE]
>  This data comes from a mixture of discovery and inventory data. By default, inventory runs every week, so this information may be out-of-date.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_NAPRestrictionErrorSummary : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String Description;  
      String ErrorCode;  
      UInt32 Last30DaysCount;  
      UInt32 Last7DaysCount;  
      UInt32 LastDayCount;  
      DateTime LastSummaryTime;  
};
