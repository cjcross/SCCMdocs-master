# SMS_UserClassPermissionNames Server WMI Class
The `SMS_UserClassPermissionNames` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that lists all the users and the permissions granted to each user for each secured class.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax

Class SMS_UserClassPermissionNames : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      UInt32 ObjectKey;  
      UInt32 Permission;  
      String PermissionName;  
      String UserName;  
};  
```
