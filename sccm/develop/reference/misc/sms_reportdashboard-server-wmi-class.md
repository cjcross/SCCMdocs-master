# SMS_ReportDashboard Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ReportDashboard` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a collection of reports tiled across and displayed as a single page in Web reports.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ReportDashboard : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      UInt32 ColumnCount;  
      String Comment;  
      UInt32 DashboardID;  
      String Name;  
      UInt32 ReportIDs[];  
      UInt32 RowVerticalLimit;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_ReportDashboard` class does not define any methods.
