# SMS_NAPSystemInfo Server WMI Class
The `SMS_NAPSystemInfo` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents Network Access Protection (NAP) related system information.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The logic used to populate `NAPIncapableCount` does not take Windows XP Professional SP2 x64 Edition into consideration. Client computers running this operating system will not appear under this property.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_NAPSystemInfo : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      UInt32 NAPEnabledCount;  
      UInt32 NAPIncapableCount;  
      UInt32 NAPRestrictedCount;  
      UInt32 NAPUpgradeableCount;  
      UInt32 TotalCount;  
};  
```

 The `SMS_NAPSystemInfo` class does not define any methods.
