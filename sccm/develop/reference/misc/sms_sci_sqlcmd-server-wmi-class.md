# SMS_SCI_SQLCmd Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SCI_SQLCmd` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that defines a Structured Query Language (SQL) command to be run periodically directly in the SQL Server database.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SCI_SQLCmd : SMS_SiteControlItem   
{  
     DateTime BeginTime;  
     UInt32 DaysOfWeek;  
     UInt32 FileType;  
     String ItemName;  
     String ItemType;  
     DateTime LatestBeginTime;  
     String LogFile;  
     String Name;  
     UInt32 NumRefreshDays;  
     Boolean On;  
     String SiteCode;  
     String SQLCmd;  
};  
```
