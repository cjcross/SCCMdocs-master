The `SMS_ObjectToInstancePermissions_a` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that relates a secured object with users that have permissions for an instance of the secured object.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ObjectToInstancePermissions_a : SMS_BaseAssociation  
{  
      ref:SMS_UserInstancePermissions instancePermissions;  
      ref:SMS_SecuredObject object;  
};  
```  

## Properties

 Data type: `ref;SMS_UserInstancePermissions`  

 Access type: Read  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Reference to an [SMS_UserInstancePermissions Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/misc/sms_userinstancepermissions-server-wmi-class.md) object path uniquely identifying the location of the permissions object.  

 `object`  
 Data type: `ref:SMS_SecuredObject`  

 Access type: Read  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Reference to an [SMS_SecuredObject Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/misc/sms_securedobject-server-wmi-class.md) object path uniquely identifying the location of the secured object.  

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

-   Read (read-only)
