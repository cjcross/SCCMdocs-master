# SMS_AmPolicySummary Server WMI Class
The `SMS_AmPolicySummary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents the endpoint protection client antimalware policy status.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This class is only for customized antimalware policy summary.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_AmPolicySummary : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AppliedCount;  
    DateTime AssignmentTime;  
    UInt32 ClientSettingsID;  
    String CollectionID;  
    String CollectionName;  
    UInt32 FailureCount;  
    UInt32 ID;  
    DateTime LastClientUpdateTime;  
    UInt32 NotAppliedCount;  
    UInt32 TotalCount;  
    UInt32 UnknownCount;  
};  
```
