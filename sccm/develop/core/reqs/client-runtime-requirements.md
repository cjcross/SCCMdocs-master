# Configuration Manager Client Runtime Requirements
Applications that run on Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager clients have the following runtime requirements.  

## Managed Code  

-   System Center Configuration Manager client  

-   Microsoft .NET Framework version 4  

## VBScript  

-   System Center Configuration Manager client  

-   Windows Script Host  

## Windows 64-Bit Support  
 A 32-bit compiled application that uses Configuration Manager SDK interfaces to access Configuration Manager client or Configuration Manager server functionality works when it runs in 32-bit emulation on a 64-bit Windows operating system. However, a 64-bit compiled application that uses Configuration Manager SDK interfaces that access 32-bit Configuration Manager client or Configuration Manager server functionality does not work. Similarly, Configuration Manager SDK scripts do not work when the scripting host is a native 64-bit application. A Configuration Manager SDK script does work if it is called from within a 32-bit scripting host.  

 The Configuration Manager client has a native 64-bit version that is installed automatically on Windows 64-bit operating systems.  Applications that relied on the 32-bit interfaces to be present may need to be re-compiled in a native 64-bit environment to interact with the Configuration Manager client APIs.  

## General Requirements  
 For more information about System Center Configuration Manager client requirements, see [Supported Configurations for Configuration Manager](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=248211).
