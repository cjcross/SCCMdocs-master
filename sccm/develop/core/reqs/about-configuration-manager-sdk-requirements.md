# About Configuration Manager SDK Requirements
Developing applications and scripts for Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager can be done using a number of development languages and tools. Which one you use depends on the type of application you are writing. Large applications will likely be written in C# using the managed Configuration Manager SDK libraries. VBScript is a good choice for scripting Configuration Manager.  

 This documentation provides examples in C#, VBScript and, where appropriate, C++.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are programming with another .NET Framework language, use the C# examples for reference.  

## Development Tools  
 Visual Studio 2010 provides a suitable environment for developing Configuration Manager applications and scripts. For more information about Visual Studio hardware requirements, see [Visual Studio 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=110322).  

## Development Requirements  
 For information about development requirements, see [Configuration Manager Client Development Requirements](../../../develop/core/reqs/client-development-requirements.md) and [Configuration Manager Server Development Requirements](../../../develop/core/reqs/server-development-requirements.md).  

## Runtime Requirements  
 For information about runtime requirements, see [Configuration Manager Client Runtime Requirements](../../../develop/core/reqs/client-runtime-requirements.md) and [Configuration Manager Server Runtime Requirements](../../../develop/core/reqs/server-runtime-requirements.md).
