# About the Unique Identifier Value for a Resource
In System Center Configuration Manager, the Configuration Manager unique identifier property for a new resource class is optional. If you report inventory data for the resource, you must include this property. The Configuration Manager unique identifier value must be unique â€” it relates your resource discovery data to your inventory data (SMS_G_xxx). Typically, hardware resources use a GUID to uniquely identify individual resources.  

 The format of the Configuration Manager unique identifier value is as follows.  

```  
<ID Type>:<ID Value>  
```  

 For example, Configuration Manager uses a GUID to identify Configuration Manager clients.  

```  
GUID:4976DCD4-CAAE-11D2-8E00-00104BCC3648  
```  

 You can use any \<ID Type> and \<ID Value> values to identify a new resource. However, when discovering data for an existing resource type, you should follow the convention that is used by that resource type.
