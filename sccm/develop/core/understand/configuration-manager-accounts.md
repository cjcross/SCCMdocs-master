# Configuration Manager Accounts
In System Center Configuration Manager, user accounts connect to site systems and Active Directory to perform various tasks. Prior to System Center Configuration Manager, the Manage Site Accounts tool (MSAC) was used to manage these user accounts. That tool has been deprecated, however new WMI methods support managing site accounts.
