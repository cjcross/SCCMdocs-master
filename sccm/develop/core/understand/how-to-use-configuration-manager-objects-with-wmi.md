# How to Use Configuration Manager Objects with WMI
This section provides information about using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to manage System Center Configuration Manager objects. For example, you will find information about creating and updating objects. You will also find information on performing asynchronous and synchronous queries. All samples provided in VBScript.  

 For information about securing System Center Configuration Manager objects, see [Securing Configuration Manager Applications](../../../develop/core/understand/securing-configuration-manager-applications.md). For information about error handling, see [Configuration Manager Errors](../../../develop/core/understand/configuration-manager-errors.md).
