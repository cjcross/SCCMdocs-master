# How to Use Configuration Manager Objects with Managed Code
This section provides code examples for using the managed SMS Provider library with Configuration Manager objects. The examples generally use packages for illustration, but they can be easily adapted to use other Configuration Manager objects.  

 For information about securing System Center Configuration Manager objects, see [Securing Configuration Manager Applications](../../../develop/core/understand/securing-configuration-manager-applications.md). For information about error handling, see [Configuration Manager Errors](../../../develop/core/understand/configuration-manager-errors.md).
