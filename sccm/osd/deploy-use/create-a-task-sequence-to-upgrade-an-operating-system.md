# Create a task sequence to upgrade an operating system in System Center Configuration Manager*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*
Use task sequences in System Center Configuration Manager to automatically upgrade an operating system from Windows 7 or later to Windows 10, or Windows Server 2012 or later to Windows Server 2016, on a destination computer. You create a task sequence that references the operating system image that you want to install on the destination computer and any other additional content, such as applications or software updates that you want to install. The task sequence to upgrade an operating system is part of the [Upgrade Windows to the latest version](upgrade-windows-to-the-latest-version.md) scenario.  

##  <a name="BKMK_UpgradeOS"></a> Create a task sequence to upgrade an operating system  
 To upgrade the operating system on computers, you can create a task sequence and select **Upgrade an operating system from upgrade package** in the Create Task Sequence Wizard. The wizard adds the steps to upgrade the operating system, apply software updates, and install applications. Before you create the task sequence, the following must be in place:    

-   **Required**  

     - The [operating system upgrade package](../get-started/manage-operating-system-upgrade-packages.md) must be available in the Configuration Manager console.
     - When you upgrade to Windows Server 2016, you must select the **Ignore any dismissable compatibility messages** setting in the Upgrade Operating System task sequence step or the upgrade fails.

-   **Required (if used)**  

    -   [Software updates](../../sum/get-started/synchronize-software-updates.md) must be synchronized in the Configuration Manager console.  

    -   [Applications](../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md) must be added to the Configuration Manager console.  

#### To create a task sequence that upgrades an operating system  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Software Library**.  

2.  In the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Operating Systems**, and then click **Task Sequences**.  

3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Task Sequence** to start the Create Task Sequence Wizard.  

4.  On the **Create a New Task Sequence** page, click **Upgrade an operating system from upgrade package**, and then click **Next**.  

5.  On the **Task Sequence Information** page, specify the following settings, and then click **Next**.  

    -   **Task sequence name**: Specify a name that identifies the task sequence.  

    -   **Description**: Specify a description of the task that is performed by the task sequence.  

6.  On the **Upgrade the  Windows Operating System** page, specify the following settings, and then click **Next**.  

    -   **Upgrade package**: Specify the upgrade package that contains the operating system upgrade source files. You can verify  that you have selected the correct upgrade package by looking at the information in the **Properties** pane. For more information, see [Manage operating system upgrade packages](../get-started/manage-operating-system-upgrade-packages.md).  

    -   **Edition index**: If there are multiple operating system edition indexes available in the package, select the desired edition index. By default, the first item is selected.  

    -   **Product key**: Specify the product key for the Windows operating system to install. You can specify encoded volume license keys and standard product keys. If you use a non-encoded product key, each group of five characters must be separated by a dash (-). For example: *XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX*. When the upgrade is for a volume license edition, the product key is not required. You only need a product key when the upgrade is for a retail Windows edition.  

    -   **Ignore any dismissable compatibility messages**: Select this setting if you are upgrading to Windows Server 2016. If you do not select this setting, the task sequence fails to complete because Windows Setup is waiting for the user to click **Confirm** on a Windows app compatibility dialog.   

7.  On the **Include Updates** page, specify whether to install required software updates, all software updates, or no software updates, and then click **Next**. If you specify to install software updates, Configuration Manager installs only those software updates that are targeted to the collections that the destination computer is a member of.  

8.  On the **Install Applications** page, specify the applications to install on the destination computer, and then click **Next**. If you specify multiple applications, you can also specify that the task sequence continues if the installation of a specific application fails.  

9. Complete the wizard.  



## Configure pre-cache content
Beginning in version 1702, for available deployments of task sequences, you can choose to use the pre-cache feature to have clients download only relevant content before a user installs the content.
> [!TIP]  
> Introduced with version 1702, the pre-cache is a pre-release feature. To enable it, see [Use pre-release features from updates](/sccm/core/servers/manage/pre-release-features).

For example, let's say you want to deploy a Windows 10 in-place upgrade task sequence, only want a single task sequence for all users, and have multiple architectures and/or languages. Prior to version 1702, if you create an available deployment, and then the user clicks **Install** in Software Center, the content downloads at that time. This adds additional time before the installation is ready to start. Also, all content referenced in the task sequence is downloaded. This includes the operating system upgrade package for all languages and architectures. If each is roughly three GB in size, the download package can be quite large.

Pre-cache content gives you the option to allow the client to only download the applicable content as soon as it receives the deployment. Therefore, when the user clicks **Install** in Software Center, the content is ready and the installation starts quickly because the content is on the local hard drive.

### To configure the pre-cache feature

1. Create operating system upgrade packages for specific architectures and languages. Specify the architecture and language on the **Data Source** tab of the package. For the language, use the decimal conversion (for example, 1033 is the decimal for English and 0x0409 is the hexadecimal equivalent). For details, see [Create a task sequence to upgrade an operating system](/sccm/osd/deploy-use/create-a-task-sequence-to-upgrade-an-operating-system).

    The architecture and language values are used to match task sequence step conditions that you create in the next step to determine whether the operating system upgrade package should be pre-cached.
2. Create a task sequence with conditional steps for the different languages and architectures. For example, for the English version you could create a step like the following:

    ![pre-cache properties](../media/precacheproperties2.png)

    ![pre-cache options](../media/precacheoptions2.png)  

3. Deploy the task sequence. For the pre-cache feature, configure the following:
    - On the **General** tab, select **Pre-download content for this task sequence**.
    - On the **Deployment settings** tab, configure the task sequence with the **Available** for **Purpose**. If you create a **Required** deployment, the pre-cache functionality will not work.
    - On the **Scheduling** tab, for the **Schedule when this deployment will be available** setting, choose a time in the future that gives clients enough time to pre-cache the content before the deployment is made available to users. For example, you can set the available time to be 3 hours in the future to allow enough time for the content to be pre-cached.  
    - On the **Distribution Points** tab, configure the **Deployment options** settings. If the content is not pre-cached on a client before a user starts the installation, these settings are used.


### User experience
- When the client receives the deployment policy, it will start to pre-cache the content. This includes all referenced content (any other package types) and only the operating system upgrade package that matches the client based on the conditions that you set in the task sequence.
- When the deployment is made available to users (setting on the **Scheduling** tab of the deployment), a notification displays to inform users about the new deployment and the deployment becomes visible in Software Center. The user can go to Software Center and click **Install** to start the installation.
- If the content is not fully pre-cached, then it will use the settings specified on the **Deployment Option** tab of the deployment. We recommend that there is sufficient time between when the deployment is created and the time in which the deployment becomes available to users to allow clients enough time to pre-cache the content.



## Download Package Content task sequence step  
 The [Download Package Content](../understand/task-sequence-steps.md#BKMK_DownloadPackageContent) step can be used before the **Upgrade Operating System** step in the following scenarios:  

-   You use a single upgrade task sequence that can work with both x86 and x64 platforms. To do  this, include two **Download Package Content** steps in the **Prepare for Upgrade** group with conditions to detect the client architecture and download only the appropriate operating system upgrade package. Configure each **Download Package Content** step to use the same variable, and use the variable for the media path on the **Upgrade Operating System** step.  

-   To dynamically download an applicable driver package, use two **Download Package Content** steps with conditions to detect the appropriate hardware type for each driver package. Configure each **Download Package Content** step to use the same variable, and use the variable for the **Staged content** value in drivers section on the **Upgrade Operating System** step.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > When there is more than one package, Configuration Manager adds a numerical suffix to the variable name. For example, if you specify a variable of %mycontent% as a custom variable, this is the root for where all the referenced content is stored (which can be multiple packages). When you refer to the variable in a subsequence step, such as Upgrade Operating System, it is used with a numerical suffix. In this example, %mycontent01% or %mycontent02% where the number corresponds to the order in which the package is listed in this step.

## Optional post-processing task sequence steps  
 After you create the task sequence, you can add additional steps to uninstall applications with known compatibility issues, or add post-processing actions to run after the computer is restarted and the upgrade to Windows 10 is successful. Add these additional steps in the Post-Processing group of the task sequence.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Because this task sequence is not linear, there are conditions on steps that can affect the results of the task sequence, depending on whether it successfully upgrades the client computer or if it has to roll back the client computer to the operating system version it started with.  

## Optional rollback task sequence steps  
 When something goes wrong with the upgrade process after the computer is restarted, Setup will roll back the upgrade to the previous operating system and the task sequence will continue with any steps in the Rollback group. After you create the task sequence, you can add optional steps to the Rollback group.  

## Folder and files removed after computer restart  
 When the task sequence to upgrade an operating system to Windows 10 and all other steps in the task sequence are complete, the post-processing and rollback scripts are not removed until the computer is restarted.  These script files do not contain sensitive information.
