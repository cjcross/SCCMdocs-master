# Remotely synchronize policy on Intune-enrolled devices from the Configuration Manager console

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


You can request a policy sync for a device that is enrolled with Intune from the Configuration Manager console instead of having to request a sync from the Company Portal app on the device itself. 

To do this:

1.	Select a device under **Assets and Compliance** > **Overview** > **Devices**.
2.	Click **Send Sync Request** in the **Remote Device Actions** menu.


After five to ten minutes, any changes in policy will be synced to the device. You can view sync request state information in a new column in device views, called **Remote Sync State**, as well as in the discovery data section of the **Properties** dialog box for each device.
