# Protect data and devices in On-premises Mobile Device Management

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

You want your users to be able to securely access your organization's resources, so that both your infrastructure and your data are protected from exposure or malicious attack.

Follow the same guidance for hybrid MDM deployments (listed below) to help protect your organization's resources:

- [Create Wi-Fi profiles](create-wifi-profiles.md)
- [Create PFX certificate profiles](create-pfx-certificate-profiles.md)
- [Create VPN profiles](create-vpn-profiles.md)
- [Create email profiles](create-exchange-activesync-profiles.md)
