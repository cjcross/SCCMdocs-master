# How to create Wi-Fi profiles for mobile devices in System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Use Wi-Fi profiles in System Center Configuration Manager to deploy wireless network settings to mobile device users in your organization. By deploying these settings, you make it easier for your users to connect to Wi-Fi.  

You can configure the following mobile device types with Wi-Fi profiles:  

-   Devices that run Windows Phone 8.1  

-   Devices that run Windows 10 Desktop or Mobile  

-   IPhone devices that run iOS 9  

-   IPad devices that run iOS 9  

-   Android devices that run version 4 or later

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To deploy profiles to Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and enrolled Windows 8.1 or later devices, these devices must be enrolled in Microsoft Intune. For information about how to get your devices enrolled, see [Enroll devices for management in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/deploy-use/enroll-devices-in-microsoft-intune).  

[Create a Wi-Fi profile](../../protect/deploy-use/create-wifi-profiles.md#create-a-wi-fi-profile) provides general information about how to use Wi-Fi profiles in Configuration Manager to deploy wireless network settings to users.

See [Deploy Wi-Fi, VPN, email, and certificate profiles](../../protect/deploy-use/deploy-wifi-vpn-email-cert-profiles.md) for information about deploying Wi-Fi profiles.
