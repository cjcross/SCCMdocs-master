# Migrate hybrid MDM users and devices to Intune standalone

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*    

When you have decided that you are ready to start migrating from hybrid MDM (Intune integrated with Configuration Manager) to a cloud-only experience using Intune on Azure, this is the article is for you. If you are still unsure, see [Choose between Microsoft Intune standalone and hybrid mobile device management with System Center Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/mdm/understand/choose-between-standalone-intune-and-hybrid-mobile-device-management). 

You can start migrating to Intune standalone using a phased approach that allows you to test a small subset of users and devices while most of your users and devices are still managed with hybrid MDM. Then, after you verify Intune functionality, you can start migrating more users to Intune.    

The following topics provide the steps to migrate your users to Intune standalone using a phased approach.    
  
1.	[Import Configuration Manager data to Microsoft Intune](migrate-import-data.md)   
    The Intune Data Importer tool collects data about the objects you select from your Configuration Manager hierarchy, provides details about the objects you can select for import and information about why some object cannot be imported, and lets you import selected objects into your Microsoft Intune tenant. While this step is optional, it can save you a lot of time by automating the process to recreate objects from Configuration Manager to Intune. 
2.	[Prepare Intune for user migration](migrate-prepare-intune.md)    
    Validate imported objects from Configuration Manager, create new objects, create AAD groups and make object assignments to these groups, install NDES and Exchange connectors, etc. When you complete the steps and start the migration to Intune standalone, it should be transparent to your users.  
3.	[Change the MDM authority for specific users (mixed MDM authority)](migrate-mixed-authority.md)    
    Configure a mixed MDM authority in the same tenant by selecting some users to be managed in Intune and while all other devices continue to be managed with hybrid MDM (Intune integrated with Configuration Manager). You can test that Intune functionality is working as expected on the devices for a small subset of users before you start migrating additional users. 
4.	[Change your MDM authority to Intune standalone](change-mdm-authority.md)     
    Change your tenant-level MDM authority from Configuration Manager to Intune. All remaining users and devices are migrated to Intune standalone. You will change your tenant-level MDM authority after you have thoroughly tested Intune functionality in the previous step and have likely migrated most or all of your users already.

<!--
The following provides a typical workflow for migrating users from hybrid MDM to Intune standalone:
1.	Admin runs the Microsoft Intune Data Importer Tool, selecting which objects and assignments to import. Selected objects are imported into Intune standalone.
    1. Some objects cannot be imported because they contain settings the tool does not understand or setting that are not available in Intune standalone.
    2. Assignments are migrated. However, only if the collection an object was targeted to is based on a single Active Directory (AD) security group and the same group exists in Azure Active Directory (AAD).
    > [!Note]    
    > If you want, you can skip this step and create the objects that you want directly in Intune in the Azure portal without running the Intune Data Importer Tool. 
2.	Admin logs into the Intune on Azure portal
    1. Creates any additional objects required for their organization that were not imported by the Microsoft Intune Data Importer tool.
    2. Creates any required AAD groups and makes any additional assignments for each object to AAD groups.
    3. Installs the NDES connector on an on-premises server if using SCEP or PFX certificate deployment.
    4. Installs the Exchange connector on an on-premises server if using conditional access. 
3.	Admin ensures that all existing Intune users in their organization have an Intune license assigned to them using AAD or the Office administrator portal.
4.	Admin selects some test users to migrate to Intune standalone and removes them from the collection associated with the Intune subscription in Configuration Manager.
5.	Once removed from the collection, the user and all devices are managed by Intune in the Azure portal. Remaining users and devices continue to be managed by hybrid mobile device management in Configuration Manager. 
6.	Admin validates that things are working as expected on the device and moves more users to Intune standalone by removing them from the collection associated with the Intune subscription in Configuration Manager.
7.	Once the admin is comfortable with the functionality in Intune standalone, they can move the rest of their users and devices by switching their MDM authority to Intune standalone. This can be done by removing the Intune subscription from SCCM and choosing to change the MDM authority. Tenant level policies will be automatically migrated to Intune standalone, all objects and assignments in Intune standalone will remain, and devices will not be required to re-enroll.
