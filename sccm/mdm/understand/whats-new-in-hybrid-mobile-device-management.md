##  Compatibility with Configuration Manager versions  
Each section of this article lists hybrid features under three different categories. Use the following guidance to determine compatibility of the features in each category with different versions of Configuration Manager:  

|Feature categories|Description|
|-|-|
|**New in Microsoft Intune** | In general, all the features listed under this category should work with all Configuration Manager releases. This including System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager releases, since these features only require the Intune service and do not require additional functionality in Configuration Manager.|
|**New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview**| All the features listed under this category only work with the specified Technical Preview release. To try out these features, you must install the Technical Preview version specified in the feature description. For more information, see [Technical Preview for System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/get-started/technical-preview.md).|
|**New in Configuration Manager (current branch)**| All the features listed under this category only work with the specified version of Configuration Manager (current branch), such as version 1511 or 1602. If you're using an older version of Configuration Manager for your hybrid deployment, you must upgrade to the Configuration Manager (current branch)  version specified in the feature description. For more information, see [Upgrade to System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/servers/deploy/install/upgrade-to-configuration-manager.md).|


## November 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **Access to managed app logs for iOS** <!-- 1469920 -->
  End users with the managed Browser installed can now view the management status of all Microsoft published apps and send logs for troubleshooting their managed iOS apps.
  
  Learn how to enable the troubleshooting mode in the Managed Browser on an iOS device, see [How to access to managed app logs using the Managed Browser on iOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/app-configuration-managed-browser#how-to-access-to-managed-app-logs-using-the-managed-browser-on-ios).


## October 2017

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1709

- **Improved VPN Profile experience in Configuration Manager console** <!-- 1313282 -->     
  VPN profile settings are now filtered according to platform. When you create new VPN profiles, each supported platform contains only the settings appropriate for the platform. Existing VPN profiles are not affected. You can read more about this change [here](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1709#improved-vpn-profile-experience-in-configuration-manager-console).


### New in Microsoft Intune  

- **Certificate-based authentication support on the Company Portal for iOS** <!--1029830-->
  We have added support for certificate-based authentication (CBA) in the Company Portal app for iOS. Users with CBA enter their username, then tap the “Sign in with a certificate” link. CBA is already supported on the Company Portal apps for Android and Windows. You can learn more on the [sign in to the Company Portal app](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal) page.

- **Improvements to device setup workflow in Company Portal** <!--1490692-->    
  We've improved the device setup workflow in the Company Portal app for Android. The language is more user-friendly and specific to your company, and we've combined screens where possible. You can see these on the [what's new in app UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui#week-of-october-2-2017) page.

- **Improved guidance around the request for access to contacts on Android devices** <!--1484985-->    
  The Company Portal app for Android often requires the end user to accept the Contacts permission. If an end user declines this access, they will now see an in-app notification that alerts them to grant it for conditional access. 

- **Secure startup remediation for Android** <!--1490712-->    
  End users with Android devices will be able to tap the non-compliance reason in the Company Portal app. When possible, this will take them directly to the correct location in the settings app to fix the issue. 

- **Additional push notifications for end users on the Company Portal app for Android Oreo** <!--1475932 -->    
  End users will see additional notifications to indicate to them when the Company Portal app for Android Oreo is performing background tasks, such as retrieving policies from the Intune service. The notifications increase transparency for end users about when the Company Portal is performing administrative tasks on their device. This is part of the overall [optimization of the Company Portal UI](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/intunesupport/2017/08/21/android-8-0-o-behaviour-changes-and-microsoft-intune) for the Company Portal app for Android Oreo. 

- **New behaviors for the Company Portal app for Android with work profiles** <!--1485783-->    
  When you enroll an Android for Work device with a work profile, it's the Company Portal app in the work profile that performs management tasks on the device. 

  Unless you are using a MAM-enabled app in the personal profile, the Company Portal app for Android no longer serves any use. To improve the work profile experience, Intune will automatically hide the personal Company Portal app after a successful work profile enrollment.

  The Company Portal app for Android can be enabled at any time in the personal profile by browsing for [Company Portal in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal) and tapping **Enable**.

- **Company Portal for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 moving to sustaining mode** <!--1428681-->    
 A notice was added to announce that Company Portal apps for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 are moving to sustaining mode. For details, see [Notices](#notices).  

- **Block unsupported Samsung Knox device enrollment** <!-- 1490695 -->    
  The Company Portal app only attempts to enroll supported Samsung Knox devices. To avoid KNOX activation errors that prevent MDM enrollment, device enrollment is only attempted if the device appears in the [list of devices published by Samsung](https://www.samsungknox.com/knox-supported-devices/knox-workspace). Samsung devices can have model numbers that support KNOX while others that don't. Verify Knox compatibility with your device reseller before purchase and deployment. You can find the full list of verified devices in the [Android and Samsung KNOX Standard policy settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-classic/deploy-use/android-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune#supported-samsung-knox-standard-devices).

- **End of support for Android 4.3 and lower** <!--1171126, 1326920 -->    
  A notice was added for end of support for Android 4.3 and lower. For details, see [Notices](#notices).

- **Inform end users what device information can be seen on enrolled devices** <!--1165314-->    
  We are adding **Ownership Type** to the Device Details screen on all Company Portal apps. This will allow users to find out more about privacy directly from the [What information can your company see?](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/what-info-can-your-company-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune) article. This will be rolling out across all Company Portal apps in the near future. We announced this for iOS in [September](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new#week-of-september-11-2017). 


## September 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune     

- **Refresh action added to the Company Portal app for Windows 10** <!-- 1132468 -->    
    The Company Portal app for Windows 10 allows users to refresh the data in the app by either pulling to refresh or, on desktops, pressing F5.

- **Inform end users what device information can be seen for iOS** <!--739894-->    
    We have added  **Ownership Type** to the Device Details screen on the Company Portal app for iOS. This will allow users to find out more about privacy directly from this page from the Intune end user docs. They will also be able to locate this information on the About screen. 

- **Easier-to-understand phrasing for the Company Portal app for Android** <!---1396349-->       
    The enrollment process for the Company Portal app for Android has been simplified with new text to make it easier for end users to enroll. If you have custom enrollment documentation, you will want to update it to reflect the new screens. You can find sample images on our [UI updates for Intune end user apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui#week-of-september-11-2017) page.

- **Windows 10 Company Portal app added to Windows Information Protection allow policy** <!-- 677129 -->    
    The Windows 10 Company Portal app has been updated to support Windows Information Protection (WIP). The app can be added to the WIP allow policy. With this change, the app no longer has to be added to the **Exempt** list. 

     Only a single WIP configuration item can be delivered to a device.  If two WIP configuration items are targeted to the same device, neither WIP policy applies.

- **End of support notice added for iOS 8.0**    
    A notice was added for end of support for iOS 8.0. For details, see [Notices](#notices).

## August 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune     

- **New signed-in experience for Android Company Portal users and App Protection Policy users** <!-- 621669 -->    
End users can now browse apps, manage devices, and view IT contact information using the Android Company Portal app without enrolling their Android devices. In addition, if an end user already uses an app protected by Intune App Protection Policies and launches the Android Company Portal, the end user no longer receive a prompt to enroll the device.


## July 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- [Android and iOS enrollment restrictions](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1706#android-and-ios-enrollment-restrictions) 

## June 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **Change your MDM authority**

  Beginning in Configuration Manager version 1610, you can change your MDM authority without having to contact Microsoft Support and without having to unenroll and reenroll your existing managed devices. For details, see [Change your MDM authority](/sccm/mdm/deploy-use/change-mdm-authority).

- **Managed browser and app proxy integration**

  The Intune Managed Browser can now integrate with the Azure AD Application Proxy service to let users access internal web sites even when they are working remotely. Users of the browser enter the site URL as they normally would and the Managed Browser routes the request through the application proxy web gateway. For more information, see [Manage Internet access using Managed browser policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/app-configuration-managed-browser).

- **Company Portal app for Android now has a new end-user experience for App Protection Policies**

  Based on customer feedback, we've modified the Company Portal app for Android to show an **Access Company Content** button. The intent is to prevent end users from unnecessarily going through the enrollment process when they only need to access apps that support App Protection Policies, a feature of Intune mobile application management. You can see these changes on the [what's new in app UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui) page.

- **New menu action to easily remove Company Portal**

  Based on user feedback, the Company Portal app for Android has added a new menu action to initiate the removal of Company Portal from your device. This action removes the device from Intune management so that the app can be removed from the device by the user. You can see these changes on the [what's new in app UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui) page and in the [Android end-user documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android).

- **Improvements to app syncing with Windows 10 Creators Update**

  The Company Portal app for Windows 10 now automatically initiates a sync for app install requests for devices with Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703). This reduces the issue of app installs stalling during the "Pending Sync" state. In addition, users are able to manually initiate a sync from within the app. You can see these changes on the [what's new in app UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui) page.

- **New guided experience for Windows 10 Company Portal**

  The Company Portal app for Windows 10 includes a guided Intune walkthrough experience for devices that have not been identified or enrolled. The new experience provides step-by-step instructions that guide the user through registering into Azure Active Directory (required for Conditional Access features) and MDM enrollment (required for device management features). The guided experience will be accessible from the Company Portal home page. Users can continue to use the app if they do not complete registration and enrollment, but will experience limited functionality.

  This update is only visible on devices running Windows 10 Anniversary Update (build 1607) or higher. You can see these changes on the [what's new in app UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui) page.

- **Improvements to the app tiles in the Company Portal app for iOS**

  We updated the design of the app tiles on the homepage to reflect the branding color you set for the Company Portal. For more information, see [what's new in app UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

- **Account picker now available for the Company Portal app for iOS**

  Users of iOS devices might see our new account picker when they sign into the Company Portal if they use their work or school account to sign into other Microsoft apps. For more information, see [what's new in app UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1706

- **New Windows configuration item settings**  <!-- 1354715 -->    

  New Windows configuration items are available for the Password, Device, Store, and Microsoft Edge setting categories. For more information, see [New Windows configuration item settings](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1706#new-windows-configuration-item-settings).

- **New device compliance policy rules**    

  You can now configure new options for compliance policies that were previously only available in Intune standalone. For details, see [Device compliance policy improvements](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1706#new-device-compliance-policy-rules).

- **Android and iOS enrollment restrictions** <!-- 1290826 -->      

  Admins can now specify that users cannot enroll personal Android or iOS devices in their hybrid environment. This allows you to limit enrolled devices to predeclared, company-owned devices, or iOS devices enrolled with Device Enrollment Program only. For details, see [Android and iOS enrollment restrictions](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1706#android-and-ios-enrollment-restrictions).

- **Support for Entrust certification authorities** <!-- 1350740 -->     

  Configuration Manager now supports Entrust certification authorities; this enables PFX certificate delivery to devices enrolled into Microsoft Intune.    

  You can configure Entrust as the certification authority when adding a Certificate Registration Point role in Configuration Manager. When adding a new certificate profile that issues PFX certificates, you can select either a Microsoft or Entrust certification authority.

  **Known issue**: In the 1706 technical preview, PFX certificates are not issued for Microsoft certification authorities. This does not affect imported PFX certificates or SCEP profiles.

- **Cisco (IPsec) support for macOS VPN profiles**  <!-- 1321367 -->    

  You can create a macOS VPN profile with Cisco (IPsec) as the connection type. For more information, see [Create VPN profiles](/sccm/mdm/deploy-use/create-vpn-profiles#create-vpn-profiles).


## April 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **MyApps available for Managed Browser**

  Microsoft MyApps now have better support within the Managed Browser. Managed Browser users who are not targeted for management will be brought directly to the MyApps service, where they can access their admin-provisioned SaaS apps. Users who are targeted for Intune management continue to be able to access MyApps from the built-in Managed Browser bookmark.

- **New icons for the Managed Browser and the Company Portal**

  The Managed Browser is receiving updated icons for both the Android and iOS versions of the app. The new icon will contain the updated Intune badge to make it more consistent with other apps in Enterprise Mobility + Security (EM+S). You can see the new icon for the Managed Browser on the [what's new in Intune app UI page](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

  The Company Portal is also receiving updated icons for the Android, iOS, and Windows versions of the app to improve consistency with other apps in EM+S. These icons will be gradually released across platforms from April to late May.

- **Sign in progress indicator in Android Company Portal**

  An update to the Android Company Portal app shows a sign in progress indicator when the user launches or resumes the app. The indicator progresses through new statuses, beginning with "Connecting...", then "Signing in...", then "Checking for security requirements..." before allowing the user to access the app. You can see the new screens for the Company Portal app for Android on the [what's new in Intune app UI page](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

- **Block apps from accessing SharePoint Online**

  You can now create an app-based conditional access policy to block apps, which don't have app protection policies applied to them, from accessing [SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-classic/deploy-use/mam-ca-for-sharepoint-online). In the apps-based conditional access scenario, you can specify the apps that you want to have access to SharePoint Online using the Azure portal.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1704

- **Configure Android apps with app configuration policies**

  You can use app configuration policies in System Center Configuration Manager (Configuration Manager) to distribute pre-configured settings when a user runs an app on Android for Work devices. Android app configuration policies are available only on devices running Android for Work and apply to approved apps from the Play for Work store. For information on how to try out this feature, see [Configure Android apps with app configuration policies](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1704#configure-android-apps-with-app-configuration-policies).

## March 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **New user experience for the Company Portal app for Android**

  The Company Portal app for Android has a more modern look and feel to its user interface. The notable updates are:

  - Colors: Company Portal tab headers are colored in IT-defined branding.
  - Apps: In the **Apps** tab, the **Featured Apps** and **All Apps** buttons are updated.
  - Search: In the **Apps** tab, the **Search** button is a floating action button.
  - Navigating Apps: **All Apps** view shows a tabbed view of **Featured**, **All**, and **Categories** for easier navigation.
  - Support: **My Devices** and **Contact IT** tabs are updated to improve readability.

  For more information about these changes, see [UI updates for Intune end-user apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

- **Signing Script for Windows 10 Company Portal**

  If you need to download and sideload the Windows 10 Company Portal app, you can now use a script to simplify and streamline the app-signing process for your organization.  To download the script and the instructions for using it, see  [Microsoft Intune Signing Script for Windows 10 Company Portal](https://aka.ms/win10cpscript) on TechNet Gallery. For more information about this announcement, see [Updating your Windows 10 Company Portal app](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/intunesupport/2017/03/13/updating-your-windows-10-company-portal-app/) on the Intune Support Team Blog.

- **Improved support for Android users based in China**

  Due to the absence of the Google Play Store in China, Android devices must obtain apps from Chinese marketplaces. The Company Portal supports this workflow by redirecting Android users in China to download the Company Portal and Outlook apps from local app stores. This improves the user experience when Conditional Access policies are enabled, both for Mobile Device Management and for Mobile Application Management. The Company Portal and Outlook apps for Android are available on the following Chinese app stores:

  - [Baidu](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836946)
  - [Xiaomi](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836947)
  - [Tencent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836949)
  - [Huawei](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836948)
  - [Wandoujia](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836950)

- **Make sure your Company Portal apps are up-to-date**

  In December 2016, we released an update that enabled enforcement for multi-factor authentication (MFA) on a group of users when they enroll an iOS, Android, Windows 8.1+, or Windows Phone 8.1+ device. This feature cannot work without certain baseline versions of the Company Portal app for Android (v5.0.3419.0+) and iOS (v2.1.17+).

  Intune's management capabilities are continuously improving and many improvements have coordinated updates to the Company Portal apps on all supported platforms. As a result, we recommend that you keep the latest versions of the Company Portal apps on installed on devices to take advantage of improvements in Intune and for the best user experience.

  >[!Tip]
  > Have your users set their devices to automatically update apps from the appropriate app store. If you have made the Android Company Portal app available on a network share, you can download the latest version from [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49140).

- **Microsoft Teams is now enabled for MAM on iOS and Android**

  The Microsoft Teams apps for iOS and Android are now enabled with Intune mobile app management (MAM) capabilities, so you can empower your teams to work freely across devices, while ensuring that conversations and corporate data is protected at every turn. For more details, see [the Microsoft Teams announcement](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/03/14/microsoft-teams-is-now-generally-available-and-mam-enabled-on-ios-and-android/) on the Enterprise Mobility and Security blog.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1703

- **Additional support for Apple Volume Purchase Program scenarios**

   Beginning in Technical Preview 1703, you now have support for the following Volume Purchase Program (VPP) scenarios:

   - Device licensing - Apps that support device licensing and are deployed to device collections now only require one license per device.  Previously, you had to use a license for each user on a device. For more information, see [Deploy volume-purchased iOS apps to device collections](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1703#deploy-volume-purchased-ios-apps-to-device-collections).
   - Use of multiple VPP tokens to a single hybrid tenant with both tokens used for managing VPP apps.
   - Use of VPP education tokens with the ability to distinguish between business and education tokens.

### New in Configuration Manager (current branch)

The following features that were previously available in Configuration Manager Technical Preview releases are now available in hybrid deployments with Intune and Configuration Manager (current branch) version 1702.

The following additional hybrid features are also included in version 1702 of Configuration Manager (current branch):

- **Improved support for Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP)**

  - You can now deploy licensed apps to devices as well as users. Depending on the apps ability to support device licensing, an appropriate license is claimed when you deploy it, as follows:

    | Configuration Manager version | App supports device licensing? | Deployment collection type | Claimed license |
    |-|-|-|-|
    |Earlier than 1702|Yes|User|User license|
    |Earlier than 1702|No|User|User license|
    |Earlier than 1702|Yes|Device|User license|
    |Earlier than 1702|No|Device|User license|
    |1702 and later|Yes|User|User license|
    |1702 and later|No|User|User license|
    |1702 and later|Yes|Device|Device license|
    |1702 and later|No|Device|User license|

  - You can now also deploy and track apps you purchased from the iOS Volume Purchase Program for Education.

  - You can now associate multiple Apple volume-purchase program tokens with Configuration Manager.

    For more information, see [how to monitor Mobile Threat Defense compliance](/sccm/mdm/deploy-use/monitor-mobile-threat-defense-compliance).

## February 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **Modernizing the Company Portal website**

  The Company Portal website supports apps that are targeted to users who do not have managed devices. The website aligns with other Microsoft products and services by using a new contrasting color scheme, dynamic illustrations, and a "hamburger menu," which contains helpdesk contact details and information on existing managed devices. The landing page is rearranged to emphasize apps that are available to users, with carousels for Featured and Recently Updated apps. You can find before-and-after images available on the [UI updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui) page.

- **New MDM server address for Windows devices**

  The MDM server address for enrolling Windows and Windows Phone devices has changed from manage.microsoft.com to enrollment.manage.microsoft.com. Notify your user to use enrollment.manage.microsoft.com as the MDM server address if prompted for it while enrolling a Windows or and Windows Phone device. This update also requires any CNAME in DNS that redirects EnterpriseEnrollment.contoso.com to manage.microsoft.com to be replaced with a CNAME in DNS that redirects EnterpriseEnrollment.contoso.com to EnterpriseEnrollment-s.manage.microsoft.com. For additional information about this change, visit http://aka.ms/intuneenrollsvrchange.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1702

- **Android for Work Support**

  You can now manage Android devices using Android for Work in hybrid MDM environments using Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1702. Supported Android devices can now be enrolled as Android for Work devices, which creates a work profile on the device to which apps approved in Play for Work can be deployed. You can also configure and deploy configuration items, compliance policies, and resource access profiles for these devices. For more information, see [Android for Work support](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1702#android-for-work-support).

- **Non-Compliant Apps Compliance Settings**

  You can now create non-compliant apps rules for Android and iOS apps in compliance policies. If devices have the specified applications installed, they are marked “non-compliant” and lose access to company resources according to conditional access policies in place. For more information, see [Conditional access device compliance policy improvements](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1702#conditional-access-device-compliance-policy-improvements).

- **PFX Certificate Creation and Distribution and S/MIME Support**

  You can now create and deploy PFX certificates to users in a hybrid environment. These certificates can then be used for S/MIME email encryption and decryption by devices that the user has enrolled. For more information, see [Create PFX certificates with S MIME support](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1702#create-pfx-certificates-with-s-mime-support).

- **Support for additional iOS configuration settings**
   
    You now have 42 additional iOS settings that you can configure as part of a configuration item. Most of the settings (35 in all) have been added for supervised iOS devices. For more information, see  [New compliance settings for iOS devices](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1702#new-compliance-settings-for-ios-devices).

## January 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **Android 7.1.1 support**

  Intune now fully supports and manages Android 7.1.1.

- **Resolve issue where iOS devices are inactive, or the admin console cannot communicate with them**

  When users’ devices lose contact with Intune, you can give them new troubleshooting steps to help them regain access to company resources. See [Devices are inactive, or the admin console cannot communicate with them](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-device-enrollment-in-intune#devices-are-inactive-or-the-admin-console-cannot-communicate-with-them).

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1701

- **Android and iOS versions are no longer targetable in creation wizards for hybrid MDM**

  Beginning in Technical Preview 1701 for hybrid mobile device management (MDM), you no longer need to target specific versions of Android and iOS when creating new policies and profiles for Intune-managed devices. With this change, hybrid deployments can provide support more quickly for new Android and iOS versions without needing a new Configuration Manager release or extension. To learn more, see [Android and iOS versions are no longer targetable in creation wizards](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1701#android-and-ios-versions-are-no-longer-targetable-in-creation-wizards-for-hybrid-mdm).

### Company Portal for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 moving to sustaining mode 
<!--1428681-->
*October 6, 2017*   
 
Beginning in October 2017, the Company Portal apps for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 will move to sustaining mode. This means that the apps and existing scenarios, such as enrollment and compliance, will continue to be supported for these platforms. These apps will continue to be available for download through existing release channels, such as the Microsoft Store. 

Once in sustaining mode, these apps will only will receive critical security updates. There will be no additional updates or features released for these apps. For new features, we recommend that you update devices to Windows 10 or Windows 10 Mobile. 

### End of support for iOS 8.0 
<!---1164477--->
Managed apps and the Company Portal app for iOS will require iOS 9.0 and higher to access company resources. Devices that aren't updated before September will no longer be able to access the Company Portal or those apps. 

### Platform Support Reminder: Windows Phone 8.1 mainstream support ended July 11, 2017
<!-- 1327781 -->
*July 11, 2017*

The Windows Phone 8.1 platform has reached end of mainstream support. Windows 8.1 PC support is not impacted.

There is no immediate impact to any Windows Phone 8.1 device that is managed by the Intune service, including those enrolled in hybrid MDM. Devices that are enrolled will continue to work and all policies, configurations, and apps will continue to work as expected. Please note, there are no improvements targeted for the Windows Phone 8.1 platform within the Intune service, and for the Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal app.

We recommend upgrading eligible Windows Phone 8.1 devices to Windows 10 Mobile at your earliest opportunity.  

### End of support for Android 4.3 and lower
<!---1171127--->
*July, 6, 2017*

Managed apps and the Company Portal app for Android will require Android 4.4 and higher to access company resources. Devices that aren't updated before the beginning of October will no longer be able to access the Company Portal or those apps. By December, all enrolled devices will be force retired in December, resulting in loss of access to company resources. If you are using app protection policies without MDM, apps will not receive updates, and the quality of their experience will diminish over time.


### System Center 2012 Configuration SP1 and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager (RTM): Support for hybrid mobile device management ending on April 10, 2017
*January 11, 2017*

Support for System Center 2012 Configuration Manager SP1 and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager RTM ended on July 12, 2016. Subsequently, support for these releases connecting to the Microsoft Intune service for hybrid MDM ends on April 10, 2017. After this date, hybrid MDM will stop functioning with these releases. Managed devices will essentially become unmanaged as the Intune Connector will no longer connect to the Intune service. Configuration Manager data (such as policies and applications) will not flow up to Intune and managed device data will not flow down to Configuration Manager until an upgrade takes place.

If you're running a hybrid deployment with Configuration Manager 2012 SP1 or R2 RTM, we recommend that before April 10, 2017 you upgrade to Configuration Manager (current branch) or the latest supported service pack for Configuration Manager 2012 (either R2 SP1 or SP2) to avoid disruption of service.

### Windows Phone 8 Company Portal upload deprecated
*October 25, 2016*

The ability to upload a signed Company Portal app has been removed from the Configuration Manager console, as Intune support is being deprecated for Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and Windows RT, and support for the Windows Phone 8 Company Portal is ending in November.  Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and Windows RT devices that are already enrolled will continue to be supported, but enrolling additional devices with these platforms will not be supported.
