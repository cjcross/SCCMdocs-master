# Plan for hybrid mobile device management (MDM) with System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

You can only use one management solution, the mobile device management authority, to manage your mobile devices. Before making this setting you should [choose between Microsoft Intune standalone and hybrid mobile device management with Configuration Manager](../understand/choose-between-standalone-intune-and-hybrid-mobile-device-management.md).

In addition, the [Intune Deployment Planning, Design and Implementation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/plan-design/introduction) provides a great deal of information about the process of developing a deployment plan, creating a design, onboarding Intune, and conducting a production rollout.

- [Supported Device Platforms](supported-device-platforms-for-hybrid.md) shows the mobile device platforms that are supported by Configuration Manager using Microsoft Intune.

- [Device Enrollment Methods](device-enrollment-methods.md) provides information about how to enroll corporate-owned and user-owned devices and their supported capabilities.
